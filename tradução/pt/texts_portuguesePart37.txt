116268	Here comes a depression. So better resurrect your anoraks, folks. Some chilly winds blowing in from the Arctic Circle. Climate stabilizers, what would you do without them...
116269	Thanks, Lloyd. For those who have just tuned in, I'm Lauren Beringer and this is "Global Warning" filling you in on what moves the world in 2205.
116270	However, we're reaching out into orbit today. Live from the Moon we're linked to Virgil Drake, Executive Overseer of Mining for the Lunar Excavation Corp. Good morning, Mr. Drake.
116271	Mr. Drake, as a member of the LEC, you live on the Moon 24/7. How do you view the relationship between Earth and the Moon a good century after the establishment of the first moon colony?
116272	Hard words, coming from a member of a government-owned organization...
116273	Mr. Drake, pardon me, but isn't it always easy to blame the government? The Global Union has to balance manifold interests. Take the Arctic Custodians. Their Climate Stabilizers preserve what's left of the polar regions...
116274	Actually, the Global Union is now starting the Lunar Licensing Program, awarding Moon parcels to private corporations.
116275	Indeed, the Big Five are at forefront of the Lunar Licensing Program. But don't you fear the LEC will fade into insignificance with competition like that?
116276	Our time is up. Thank you for the interview, Mr. Drake.
116277	Yes, the Lunar Licensing Program is currently the hottest topic around. We now go to our correspondent at Global Union headquarters.

13000473	All objectives achieved. Congratulations.
13000474	Mission objectives achieved. I am... Feeling... Something… Pride perhaps?
13000475	All assignments completed. Efficiency: 100%. Congratulations!
13000476	All parameters correct.
13000477	Your course of action is correct.
13000478	You have anticipated my recommendation.
13000479	You are acting logically.
13000480	Your conduct is appropriate.

13000500	I am programmed to both adapt my data structure to meet the current situation and to continually optimize it. This means I learn - just like you.
13000501	I'm not the only one of my kind. Every Ark has its own EVE. But my sisters and I are not linked. I think I sometimes --- feel --- loneliness.

109065	Ibarra-FoxCom
109066	Research Manager
109074	Electronics
109088	Ibarra-FoxCom is well-known to consumers everywhere on the globe. Consisting of two separate companies, Ibarra-FoxCom’s dual leadership once decided to pool their electronics expertise to form Earth’s biggest provider of everyday technology: Most home robots, communication systems and modern biopreparations bear the Ibarra-FoxCom label.
109075	Cassian Industries
109076	Assistant to the Vice President
109077	Heavy Industry
109261	As the foremost provider of natural resources and heavy industry products, Cassian Industries is one of the pillars of global commerce. Cassian is known for its uncompromising business policies. It led them on a path of success, but also of isolation. Today, Cassian Industries puts more funds into their own space program than any other megacorporation.
109078	Usoyev Inc.
109079	Consultant
109080	Biotech
109272	Usoyev Inc. takes pride in being a traditional venture, looking back on four generations of continued corporate success while showing no signs of old age. Yet this could change before long. The old chemical group's space program just can't seem to get off the ground and word has it that their presence on the Arctic's last oil rigs is more than questionable.
109081	Lei Sheng
109082	Head of Intelligence
109083	Energy
109273	Once one of the leading actors on the corporate stage, Lei Sheng has been ill-starred for quite some time. Certainly, the fall of Global Trust fifty years ago led to an energy supply vacuum that Lei Sheng knew how to fill. But the energy corporation has been resting too long on these past successes and now has trouble to keep the pace.
109084	Saayman International
109085	Officer for External Affairs
109087	Agriculture
109287	There is hardly a company out there that is held in higher esteem than Saayman International. From a small association of farming enterprises, Saayman grew into a food giant that now provides a considerable percentage of the global population with their daily bread. Saayman has become a world power in its own right and the corporation's ambitions are political, as well as economical.
