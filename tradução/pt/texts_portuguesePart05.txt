108665	"They captured them just before they reached the border. Get them out, before Drake gets to interrogating them."
108666	"This operative has stopped responding long ago. Well, now we know why."
108667	"Observers! Take them out before they can call for backup. These people really believe in Drake, even after all he's done..."

121246	"I've stuffed a few dead vehicles full of supplies. Can you tow them to passing refugees? They've got no time for detours."
121247	"The Watch set up obvious baits, fully-stocked stranded vehicles. Can you get them for us without setting them off?"
108681	"Sent one of me lads out to look for my last prototype. The dimwit ended up getting lost!"
108682	"My delivery drone had... uh... kind of a quarrel with its cargo. Now the stuff's all over the darn place."
108685	"Hah, quality product! That mine dismantler simply got blown to smithereens. Gonna build something better from the scraps."
108686	"Meant to sent one of those slackers to pick it up. And suddenly they're all off, pretending to be busy."
108687	"I've put it on that order list, but I need it now. Can't wait for them paper pushers to finish their coffee!"
108688	"I cut my ties with the Big Five a long time ago, but some of their underlings are decent. At least for business."
108689	"Crunch your numbers and that, but nothin' beats a hands-on test drive. And if it's just to see if you made bags of it."
108690	"One of my engineers cooked up a darn good ship fuel. Ate right through the tanks. Now she needs a lift!"
108691	"This ship's been with me for donkey's years. Can't do a thing about her defects. A proper burial, how's that sound?"
108692	"Them thick bastards showed up trying to get my blueprints! Give them hell, I say!"
108693	"Ever heard of time capsules and geocaching and that? Could use a hand, but don't you dare tell my crew about it!"
108694	"Leave that dossers on their own just one second, and the next your drones are doing nosedives."
108695	"Forgot a couple of parts out there. And what you say, the Big Five already have their greedy hands on them."
108696	"Don't tell the Beaumont girl. Some parts are just tricky to come by, for... rule-oriented people."
108697	"Long story. Just tieing up loose ends here. Don't be a stickler and help me with it, eh?"
108698	"Some sensitive weapon plans we got here. The Union's got tight security regulations for delivery."
108699	"Such a beauty. Can't leave her at the whim of those ne'er-do-wells. Hope you're in."
108700	"Why're all these thieving dimwits after my ships? Must be because mine are the best there are."
108701	"Wasn't even finished with her! And I'd rather see her at the bottom of the ocean than have those lowlifes tampering with her."
108702	"Don't come into their line of fire, with them weapons and all. But it's time to blast them into next week, it is!"
108714	"Look, I'm not a face-to-face person. And your company page states you're doing pick-up requests, too, so..."
108715	"Lei Sheng must think disguised jammers are new to me. But with the right backing I'm a pro in hide-and-seek."
108716	"My, look what Cassian left behind. I'm sure they want it back. Attached some... greetings as well."
108717	"Prezzies! I guess Santa is real after all. Or at least the Ibarra contact who dropped their security hardware there."
108718	"Part of a firm market control is knowing which goods will be scarce in a month. Yeah... knowing."
108719	"It's gonna pay back. Maybe not with the same goods you're paying off Papadakis with, but it will."
108720	"Oh, a mayday signal. From a Union functionary's personal vehicle. Let's be good citizens and help, okay?"
108721	"Care to help one of my best agents get out? A big loss for me, but I'm taking employee rights seriously."
108722	"Just got it and the tracker's infested already! Won't risk driving it again."
108723	"Can you make a ruckus? It's always a good reality-check to see how fast my emergency back-up tech responds."
108724	"Good man, that Goodwin. Once you got the Big Five's balance records he left at the agreed upon spot, I'm gonna delete the file?"
108725	"That Ibarra Fox thought she was being extra sneaky with her deep sea drones. But what's in an ocean?"
108726	"There are many rumors what Saayman transports in there. Pesticides, gene compounds... So need to take a peek!"
108727	"Take a some climate data here and some oil barrels there. The Custodians won't know anything is missing!"
108728	"Usoyev hasn't been all nice lately, at least not to its contractors. But there's a reminder on the way."
108729	"The Union's added value tax has become ridiculously high. How about we save us all the financial trouble?"
108730	"Guess what, my contact was dumb enough to get caught. I can't risk having Cassian's leader coming after me."
108731	"Happens. Not all meetings between the staff and the boss go well. But your intervention could get you on this one's good side."
108732	"Just leaked through. One of your folks is about to contact Drake's goons. You sure you want to risk that?"
108733	"No way the mob followed me here by chance. But I'm not giving in. Mind if I sent you as my vanguard?"
121248	"Saayman set up measuring posts, but I'd bet your net worth they're tampering with the data. I want to... untamper it."
108741	"A scientists of yours is forging mining permits for private companies. Turn him in and we can be reasonable."
108742	"The Big Five's carelessness... just inconceivable. We expect you to help us disposing of their industrial waste?"
108743	"We spotted stray crates in the ocean. Not stowing goods properly, this must be Jorgenson's doing."
108744	"We confronted the smugglers, but they threw their contraband overboard. Without evidence, there can be no trial."
108745	"I trust your production is prceeding according to our guidelines? We'd like a sample of your wares."
108746	"First the Union privatizes the arctic, now it phases the supply contract out. We have to get our supplies somewhere."
108747	"A mineral smuggler! In your territory! You say, you have nothing to do with it? Then bring us the ship!"
108748	"Technology is fallible, especially at these temperatures. As it is, it won't move on it's own anymore."
108749	"A ship with no flag is menacing our supply line. I'm afraid they won't respond to anything but force."
108750	"Having to sink these aggressors is a tragedy. But leaving our lands more vulnurable than they already are, is much worse."
108751	"We need weather records to be retrieved from a former Arctic settlement. It's submerged now, of course."
108752	"Our drones found irregularities in the magnetic field of the area. We need to make sure it not an illegal technology dump."
108753	"I'm glad, the Orbital Watch settled for the cargo and not the crew. But still, we need the goods."
108754	"Several thermo surveillance systems have been stolen from us. Who on Earth would want those technology?"
108755	"This transport of endangered animals must remain strictly confidential. Poaching has become profitable lately."
108756	"We're forced into a corner here and I won't take risks. Leave the Global Union out of this. Are we clear?"
108757	"Please escort these so-called traders. They can't expect me to believe this 'forgot to renew license' nonsense."
108758	"The Orbital Watch! They are holding our scientists hostage, but are stalling negotiations. We have to rely on you!"
108759	"Our head of security didn't appear at work today. Her home was empty and some hard drives were missing. What can we do?"
108760	"Irresponsible fishing is a deplorable act. Have no qualms when taking those unstaffed ships out."
108900	"Your businesspartner? Well, he just had to get out for a while! Away from the other hoggish businessmen. So we did a road trip with him."
108901	"I've got an eye on you. Don't think I don't know about every step you take."
108903	"Don't you dare touch those supplies! Not when we're breaking our backs while you sit in the lap of luxury!"
108905	"Doing business with Goodwin and the Union? You actually believe you're more than just a cash cow to them?"
108907	"You'd do well to get your people out of such a vast, open area..."
108908	"I'd suggest you leave those ships in peace. But I take it this a concept all too foreign to you?"
108909	"We're not cowering before you, bowing to your corporate whims. What will your response be, I wonder?"
108910	"You better keep your greedy hands off this! Yet, I'm sure the temptation of robbing someone is too powerful."
108911	"You keep colonizing our homelands? Then you will reap destruction. I've sown a fair share on your fields."
108915	"Jamming transmitters? A nuisance... if you can place them at the right spot. But I doubt that."
108917	"Oh, we were just having a friendly chat. They might not make it home for dinner, though."
108918	"Even if you capture our agents... The data they've gathered has already been sent to our mobile servers."
108919	"I'm not forcing anybody to fight in my stead. But I will allow everyone to defend their home."
108761	"I sent my assistant out to get me a new battery... um, a few hours ago I think."
108766	"Um, looks I miscalculated how many samples I'd need. Care to find me a second batch?"
108771	"Let's hope the cargo ship that lost these containers wasn't shipping kittens. Dibs on any scientific stuff you find."
108772	"I've built some fantastic, airtight containers, if I do say so myself. But... uh... now I need them back."
108773	"Okay, this is going to sound strange, but I need some materials to build an AI controlled vacuum cleaner. Well?"
108774	"Totally not meeting my deadline. But I know what the company's running low on. Maybe I can convince them to give me an extension!"
108775	"Let's just say one of my ultra-secret high-tech experiments... is suffering from lack of transportation."
108776	"Engine configurations. I found one that'll have Rafferty go green with envy... but it kind of wrecked the machinery."
108777	"A fully biodegradable ship developed together with the Arctic Custodians. And now for the testing!"
108778	"I've got a new shield in development. Bug testing has been good, so be ready to bring some serious firepower to the table!"
108779	"They said the order was shipped... and I've been waiting forever for it to arrive. Could it be..."
108780	"My science senses are tingling! This sector must be the location to find the right bioluminescent fish."
108781	"We've got an exchange with Cass... I mean, a partner. Top secret. But some people stole info on that."
108782	"Come on, what's the harm in... err... sharing research data? Usoyev has these amazing new AI shells..."
108783	"This is the time dilation thesis I've been working on for two years. No one but my supervisor gets to see it, okay?"
108784	"I know an A1+ supplier of corrosive goods. It'll take some discretion to get on their good side, though."
108785	"They stole my prototype! I could have it self-destruct... but I don't have the heart for that."
108786	"My bosses need to see just how useless conventional sensors are. A convincing argument for new ones."
108787	"This is the part where we kill it! Err... disable it. I mean, it's a self-controlled drone gone rogue. You know the stories."
108788	"Yikes, Lei Sheng hacked into our database! And I thought it was spam... Take out their relay server!"
121249	"My new pathfinding tool just shorted out. Think you can help cover up this outlier from investors?"
121250	"So my new scrambler killed engines instead of surveillance. Can you get the test vehicles to my teams for repairs?"
108762	"He was supposed to examine the mineral reserves in our sectors, not yours. Please, if you could bring him back on track."
108767	"We're working on a geological profile of the area. We would truck you for any mineral samples you hand in."
108790	"Seems our order was shipped to you accidentally? Of course, you'd never open someone else's mail."
108791	"Well, they got lost in your waters. Cassian isn't blaming you, but... you can imagine how this looks to our lawyers."
108792	"To ensure the absolute best quality we're currently contrasting products. You have a few samples to spare?"
108793	"My superior has taken the liberty to recommend your excellent products. We'll just deduct a small broker fee."
108794	"My superior's vessel suffered an unforeseen breakdown and I'd rather not... accost her now. Err, I pay well!"
108795	"Sabotage! Who would dare! Could this be connected to the hacker we've just released from her duties?"
108796	"Our transporter is going out of service. But you know how it is with disposal expenses."
108797	"I've been tasked with security matters. Perhaps we can collaborate on breaking Saayman's monopoly?"
108798	"Statistically, around fifty meteorites come down every day. If I could find one... I mean, it might push space mining forward."
108799	"Finding untapped mineral deposits below the is difficult, but not unheard of. We'll share the findings, agreed?"
108800	"Say, would you pick up a small order from Usoyev? Sadly my responsibilities are in the way right now."
108801	"Wonder what's going on at Lei Sheng behind closed doors? Rumors of retirement, succession, crisis..."
108802	"No, no, it's a legitimate delivery to this Arctic Custodian trader. But please, I'd prefer it to be under tight wraps."
108803	"Exciting times. And some people are always willing to pay more for discretion. We hope you are discreet."
108804	"Taking personal trips, that's clearly a violation of our vehicle contract. My superior wants them to be brought in line."
108805	"Contract advice from someone who neither uses a real name nor official means of traveling? If my superior says so."
108806	"I've received personal threats against my superior. Collaborating on this will guarantee your own security as well."
108807	"Industry espionage is not something to take lightly. This unstaffed drone is costing us both millions!"
121251	"It's an embarassement to admit, but our couriers need a speedy refuelling. Your discretion would be appreciated."
121252	"This tampering bears the hallmarks of our colleagues at Lei Sheng, but without proof... We only ask you to retrieve the vehicles."
108763	"I've made an appointment with a mechanic, but it looks like he picked the wrong place to go."
108768	An employee input the wrong address for our order. Ah well, these sort of things can happen."
108808	"Someone seems intent on sabotaging our shipments with hidden drones. So, our market position is as strong as ever."
108809	"A shipment was lost. Nothing to worry about, really. But personally, I hope the containers are undamaged."
108810	"The Global Union has requested you specifically to take on the logistics. So we stepped back on the assignment."
108811	"Usoyev is known for supporting the right companies at the right time. We'd like to extend this transaction to you."
108812	"Ah, our new employees! Right from the job market. Please escort them to me, and don't mind their attitude."
108813	"Poor folks. Have been trapped on this stranded ship for so long. Thankfully, we were able to spot them now."
108814	"Nothing but an unstaffed drone. It will serve as warning to Cassian to not overstep boundaries, yours and ours."
108815	"Those ships look abandoned. But regarding the recent terroristic attemps, we should take no risks."
108816	"Ah, just a pet issue of mine. These antique circuit board from sunken ships, you see, I'm a collector."
108817	"Don't worry, we're not planning on flowing oil. But potential deposits do need to be monitored, right."
108818	"I knew Ibarra-FoxCom was interested in our new equipment, but that they'd resort to theft..."
108819	"Lei Sheng has not been very forthcoming with our joint research results. I wish this wasn't necessary."
108820	"Our new business partner prefers anonymity and has requested you for the first delivery."
108821	"I've arranged for a special discount. You provide the goods and we provide the payment."
108822	"They stole our goods, blackmailed our chairmen and incrimated us in scandals. I'm investing in talent."
108823	"So that's what she means by retiring, working for Ibarra now. Time for a talk with an old friend."
108824	"Paradoxes which crash AIs? Just a fairytale. Won't help you against these Orbital Watch spy drones, that's certain."
108825	"Security has spotted a vehicle spying on your facilities. Just consider this a tip from a friend."
121253	"You see, I recently ordered barrels of oil. With environmental laws as they are I'd pay for a private, but speedy delivery."
121254	"I don't believe this! Our delivery ships are being held for ransom by some self-righteous hacktivist."
108764	"We've tried to keep this under wraps, but it seems a partner accidentally visited your location instead of ours."
108769	"Some of our wares had to be dropped ahead of schedule. Complications, customs..."
108826	"Ibarra-FoxCom was so kind to give us free samples. I'm sure they'll extend the favor to you, when we ask them."
108827	"We got word from Usoyev. They placed the goods and demanded that you deliver them. Fine."
108828	"We're having unexpected shortages. Saayman's greenhouses are quite the power hogs."
108829	"They ship one crate at a time? This must be Cassian's way of ridiculing us. You can take over the deal."
108830	"This is a simple towing service. There were no financial or management consulters on the ship. Understood?"
108831	"This delivery will no longer be on time, we already sent another. If you want the goods, we won't stop you."
108832	"Don't believe the intelligence those criminals claim they have on us. Blackmailers are blackmailers."
108833	"Keep privateers out of your territory and we both win. I don't want any unknown factors."
108834	"Flight 067? Yes, Leidian Airlines is an affiliated firm. But the blackbox will prove, we have nothing to do with the crashes."
108835	"Have the goods deposited, wait patiently and any outside interest will subside. You should see for yourself."
108836	"Top secret documents on the Lunar Licensing Program. If they would fall into wrong hands... we will destroy them for you."
108837	"We both don't want to fall behind in the moon race. But it seems Saayman knows exactly how they can make us."
108838	"It's important to have good security systems. We'll see if ours suffice. Get this on our ship, undetected!"
108839	"We need to know what is happening on the Moon. There's much your superiors won't tell you."
108840	"Lei Sheng is not interested in settling the matter in court. Of course our concession has to remain secret."
108841	"A talented spy, an untalented runner. But before Usoyev takes the matter to court, I'd rather pay you for settling this. "
108842	"Signing non-disclosures is easy, but keeping them seems to be difficult for some. Well, they have been warned."
108843	"The safest way I know to erase data from history. Anything you want to rid yourself of, too?"
121255	"We just purchased a pathfinding GPS by Foxcom. I, however, am not convinced it can do better than a clever human."
121256	"Don't tell me you don't want to know how FoxCom's newest automated ships work. And with that flawed surveillance..."
108765	"I heard you know an excellent specialist in genetics? I heard he's on a field trip in your sector."
108770	"We're charting the ecological balance of urban regions. Providing samples will speed up the process."
108844	"Dr. Hofwegen assured me these containers are waterproof. Still, this type of delivery seems impractical."
108845	"We've had a... collision of sorts with Lei Sheng. And it seems some containers were not recovered."
108846	"We aren't proud of running low on supplies. But we will not allow pride to blind us."
108847	"Our client has... an exquisite taste. He demanded an alternative of comparable quality and I've suggested you."
108848	"We're to receive a delegation from Ibarra-FoxCom interested in our goods. Could you bring them here?"
108849	"Application tests at Saayman International are hard. I want to know why this applicant hit maximum score, just to leave then."
108850	"True, there is our logo on the ship, but it's not ours. Saayman has a no tolerance policy regarding copycats."
108851	"Many privateers use the political situation to traffic diluted food. If the Union doesn't intervene, we have to."
108852	"Sweeping scans showed a derelict waste deposit. We can't prove it's Usoyev's, but we can't leave it either."
108853	"Saayman International has developed a new fish tracking method. If the test go well, we might sell it to the Custodians."
108854	"We just had a breakthrough. But some terroristic ethicists want to withhold the fruits of our labor."
108855	"Envying another's successes is one thing. But stealing our new fertilizer, that's bold, even for Lei Sheng."
108856	"These enhanced crops are still pending approval, but the market cannot wait any longer."
108857	"I shudder to think what this virus sample could do in the wrong hands. Handle this assignment with the uttmost secrecy."
108858	"One of our mobile marine greenhouses was abducted. Live hybrids fetch high prices of the black market."
108859	"It's time sensitive cargo. We cannot wait for the Union customs patrol to finish their routine check-ups."
108860	"A live demonstration. The drones, their engines, your weapons - it's all powered by solar energy."
108861	"We're certain these are Cassian drones. Take them out covertly. We don't want to start a trade war."
121257	"I'd like hire you for coordinating the deliveries of a sensitive nature. We don't want this traced back to us."
121258	"A cyber attack left our delivery ships unmaneuverable. I'd like you to fix this, I know you have connections to her."
115069	"Not much going on at the construction site without an architect. We're supposed to meet here."
115070	"I think I might have messed up my last courier job somewhere along the line."
115077	"There're tons of that stuff missing. And I've put everything on the order form, I know so much."
115078	"Just asked the crew if they got goods to declare. And they dumped their cargo and fled. Fishy."
115079	"We had a deal with Cassian Industries over construction materials. They cancelled last minute."
115080	"This ship's overbooked. And that's a for the passengers safety and the company's rep. We have to transfer a few people."
115081	"Aw damn, our shifts are over, but the replacement crew didn't show up yet! What's keeping them?"
115082	"So much for this high-end crane vessel prototype we got us... Gotta have a word with the site engineer!"
115083	"That ship's drawing ever nearer to our transporter. Makes me and my workmates mighty nervous."
115084	"Ain't fooling me, that ain't coast guards! I'd say we strike, before drop their cover."
115085	"After the crooks found out we bugged the goods they just dumped them. So, it's working!"
115086	"Damn, seems a some cables have been gnawed at. Rack off, fishes! The inftrastructure depends on it!"
115087	"Thing is we put our goods down in their docking area by accident. And now they refuse to hand them over."
115088	"The whole stack of blueprints, gone! Can't get back to work before we got them back."
115089	"The prototype builds are ready. But better not hang a lantern on them. Wouldn't be the first time, such thing go missing!"
115090	"Stupid security regulations! You put a wrong label on the crates, and they don't accept them. But they must be delivered!"
115091	"Faking a nautic emergency, then detaining the repair crew to get info on your company! Your rivals really mean it."
115092	"First the engine cooler breaks down and now the alarm malfunctions? What kinda day is this?"
115093	"When I heard there were terrorist attacks on sea, I didn't expect them to be so close..."
115094	"We're introducing new new training exercises for our forces! Thought you might wanna take the front rank."
115095	"This person has been an example for our whole department. A meeting with the company leader, that's our thank-you gift."
115096	"The order form says, the containers' contents are fragile. They need to be loaded individually and carefully."
115097	"I couldn't tell them in time. Ibarra-FoxCom ships left cargo behind. Giving it back might get us on their good side."
115098	"No, it my trainee misunderstood the assignment. Not sure how 'deploy' becomes 'dump', but oh well."
115099	"High priority order from Saayman incoming. Well paid. I suppose they can afford it."
115100	"The client wants the manager to deliver it personally. If you have the time, we could even surpass his expectations."
115101	"It's inspection day, but the inspector has yet to arrive. I hope the ship we sent is alright. This could become a scandal!"
115102	"This captain's papers weren't renewed on time. She may not order her ship to move. But the rulebook doesn't bar outside support."
115103	"An unnumbered vehicle, no movements, no life signs. Obviously a trap for investigation teams."
115104	"Ms. Beaumont left a memo on these ships. It seems they pose a great threat to the international peace."
115105	"There's been an anonymous tip regarding a ancient shipwreck in your sector. Just wanted to pass this on."
115106	"We had to evacuate cargo ships attacked by pirates. They sure rest in a watery grave now, but we have the coordinates."
115107	"I'm afraid we can't get another on short notice. If we only had checked our security systems beforehand."
115108	"Terrible. They... said they poisoned the food we sold to the coast guard lately. We have to withdraw them from circulation. But if the public learns of this... "
115109	"So sorry! These containers were to be delivered yesterday. But maybe the client has not yet realized they're missing."
115110	"A bulk order came from an affiliate of the Big Five. Of course they don’t want their corporate parent to know."
115111	"One of our suppliers doesn't respond. And we have a tight schedule to pass these goods on. They are pretty valuable."
115112	"S.O.S. from one of our cruise ships. The captain was ordered to stay en route, but the passengers wanted adventure. Well..."
115113	"A practice maneuver to keep our security forces alert. The ship's unmanned, so don't hold back."
115114	"Sorry, but is that an error? These ships sail under the Union's colors. But the freight documents say they've only explosives on board."
115115	"She's the one for the position! But as it is she's working for the competition. A meeting with the boss could change her mind."
115116	"Dropped where? I promise, our company won't do business with this supplier again, I swear."
115117	"I always tell them! Suplly chains only work when the suppliers actually meet. And now that!"
115118	"And one storm later... I hope the incident will convince the board to finally invest in proper retaining systems."
115119	"The honor of supplying the upcoming city festival has fallen on us. We'll have to stock up."
115120	"I've signed this temporary contract on my own responsibility. The conditions were just too tempting."
115121	"A contractor's vehicle broke down and he threatens to sue our company. Maybe if we show our good will..."
115122	"Well, this shipbuilding service is cheaper than Rafferty Dockyards. But can we leave this out of our yearly review."
115123	"The propulsion systems broken, the engines are on fire. If we move it, it would likely explode anyway."
115124	"The terrorist's intimidation tactics need to be stopped! Our employees are even taking sick days!"
115125	"Recent anomalies in sea currents could become a problem for our logistics. We should perform measurements."
115126	"We were asked to sponsor a documentary about the obsolete underwater industry. They want the perfect shooting location."
115127	"There's a recall of all IntelliWear produced this month, but this client refuses! That's a legal risk."
115128	"Their upcoming product could make ours obsolete. If we just knew exactly what we're up against..."
115129	"We're preparing a big unveiling. It would be good to have Mr. Goodwin's expertise in this matter, but discreetly."
115130	"We need material for our new haptic holograms. Best not get the press talking in this early stage, though."
115131	"The bank transfer should have been completed by now, but hasn't. Our 'client' musn't get away."
115132	"The ship belongs to Cassian Industries. We haven't given it permission to cross."
115133	"One of our investors has asked for a live demonstration of our military equipment. Let's impress them."
115134	"Our security department has been surveilling these ships long enough. If we wait any longer, monitoring costs would skyrocket."
115135	"I decided where to have the meeting after all. But I'm certainly not having our business partner be picked up by a shabby Aero Cab."
115136	"Yes, I've ordered those deliveries to remote locations. I wanted to ensure myself to the capability of your logistic!"
115137	"I wanted furniture delivered straight to my home, but it ended up who knows where! Please, be mindful of your logistics personel."
115138	"It's called 'SkiesDrop', a whole new way of delivery. But seing what transposed digits cause, I'll stay with the classics."
115139	"I don't care for your estimated delivery times. I need it now! I am investing in this megacorp, mind you."
115140	"The next regular shipment would be tomorrow, but I'm afraid our client won't wait for it."
115141	"There, I've transferred my money. Now, I want you to personally see to the delivere of my new property."
115142	"My precious Siren, she just doesn't react anymore! You may tow her in, but I won't have a single scratch on her."
115143	"Ugh, no. I thought it would turn out differently when I ordered it to be build. Get this nautic absurdity out of my sight!"
115144	"Our market shares are plummeting as long as Orbital Watch ships cross our waters unchecked. We cannot tolerate that."
115145	"Collectibles like these are only be found in old subaqua settlements. I, err, will donate them a museum, of course."
115146	"Those criminals just sank their ships. If we want to have something on them in court, we must look carefully."
115147	"You could simply sink this one raider ship. But, if you find their blind spot, you have an advantage on all of them."
115148	"You'd do the companies I own a great service by testing their surveillance systems, trust me."
115149	"The Global Union is tracking our every step. I need this list of business partners delivered, ."
115150	"I don't want this list of salary raises published. I'm not a friend of open salary policies."
115151	"We've spotted an Usoyev spy in the area. You make sure they don't get away and I'll make sure they talk."
115152	"Gosh, no! My assistant again! Participating in a Lei Sheng cruise trip? A political disaster, if this would go public!"
115153	"Insurance pay? Bah, peanuts. I just prefer my beloved ship no longer remains in the hands of those thiefs!"
115154	"I would be honored to have you in our robo battleship tournament? I upgraded my weapon systems for the occasion."
115155	"Newcomers have a hard time finding their way around here, with all the ice and snow. This one is completely lost."
115156	"A weather balloon was blown off during the last blizzard. I guess, we'll only find scattered pieces."
115157	"One of our patrols spotted unmarked cargo. Looks like this special kind of Big Five stocktake to me."
115158	"We just returned from a salvage operation. But we didn't have enough space to transport everything."
115159	"We humans often consider ourselves unstoppable. And then the frost just paralyzes your supply lines."
115160	"With the temperatures out here, we are really dependend on supply for our stations!"
115161	"A Saayman vehicle broke down. They weren't allowed to even be here, but we can't let them down nevertheless."
115162	"Let me guess. This newbie forgot to put antifreeze in the tank. Happens every once in a while."
115163	"Littering up the ocean? No, this is for testing our underwater recovery drones. We just need something to recover."
115164	"We've stripped the ships of all things toxic or dangerous. And now we'll use them as subaqua breakwaters!"
115165	"The Arctic Custodians demand we have to check on the local fish stocks regularly. It's that time again."
115166	"Some Usoyev bastards threw some cargo overboard. It could be anything! It could be toxic!"
115167	"My whole department is betting if our tech is good enough to outsneak the Arctic Custodian's surveillance."
115168	"Can you believe it? Those poachers are setting up whale traps! We must shut their systems down quickly!"
115169	"I've had it with our every request being scrutinized by the Arctic Custodians! Can't you exert your influence?"
115170	"We are having a hard time getting imported goods at a reasonable price. The Arctic Custodian tolls are quite high."
115171	"We have all the proof we need. This ship belongs to a wanted group of poachers! Detain them!"
115172	"Ibarra-FoxCom set surveillance drones on us and jammed the engines. They don't want our research to go public!"
115173	"Those raiders think because we're in the middle of nowhere, we're all helpless. You'll teach them, right?"
115174	"These are mercenary ships under Virgil Drake's contract. Do something before they turn this area into a battlefield."
115175	"I sent my colleague out to get new ground samples, but I can't wait for him to dawdle on the way back."
115176	"We had to leave our equipment behind in the field when a snowstorm hit us. Our data backups are still out there."
115177	"I decided on saving shipping costs. Now I just need someone to pick up the parcel half-way."
115178	"I had Jorgensen order a new batch for me of frozen specimens. Figures he'd lose it somewhere on the ocean."
115179	"I suppose I could order from the Custodian trader. But the company products are better, shapelier... and cheaper?"
115180	"Our lab needs restocking. Most things need to be authorised by the Custodians, so we need upper floor support."
115181	"One of the transporters has a brittle V-belt. We reinforced it, but I won't risk it breaking."
115182	"My team located an abandoned shipwreck. We want it for showcasing our new ecological engine."
115183	"As soon as you're ready, we can test your weapon systems under these extreme weather conditions."
115184	"We've received an alert by the Arctic Custodians! These Orbital Watch raiders mean business!"
115185	"I have a very specific request. I need a live sample of a Lion's Mane Jellyfish. Top-secret genetical engineering."
115186	"I'm worried about all those barrels the Usoyev freighters regularly lose during transport. Corrosion and all."
115187	"The Orbital Watch has stolen our heat shield prototype! What do they intend to with it?"
115188	"Ibarra has lured all the fish swarms here into underwater containers. This damages the ecosystem!"
115189	"A submarine observation ship needs supplies, but be careful not to disturb their research."
115190	"My old friends with the Custodians have some special requests... and you know how strict Dr. Young is."
115191	"Unknown ships are tampering with our measuring points. If the data comes out wrong, we have to start over!"
115192	"The Custodians and their poacher traps. My team was just observing and cataloguing!"
115193	"We're developing the next generation of motion detectors. You could provide some field data."
115194	"These ships have threatened to shoot at us, if we don't stop our research. And we won't to that!"
115195	"Defunct oxygen indicators aren't funny! Please, we must contact him, before he's running out of air."
115196	"A transporter convoy hit Orbital Watch landmines. With the blackboxes we can puzzle out, where the minefields are..."
115197	"Wasting food up here oughta be outlawed, I say. And leaving it lying around somewhere, too."
