117075	"Us Custodians are stretched thin. With more troops we can at least isolate this sector!"
117076	"I really need to get out of here... I'll be fine on my own, but a weapon would help with the courage!"
117077	"Okay, I don't like shooting at anyone, but I heard there's less violent methods? Just to get away?"
117078	"Custodians aren't producing any of these weapons. Too complicated, I guess?"
117079	"I had to scramble for my life! A few lost ship parts is a low price to pay. Still, I need them back."
117080	"A whole supply shipment was lost on the way! There's nothing left, we need whatever's still good!"
117081	"Alright, what I need isn't technically mine. But it doesn't belong to anyone anymore!"
117082	"Our defenses just don't hold! Quick, get the survivors to me!"
117083	"We managed a victory! The bad guys surrendered, so don't shoot, okay?"
117084	"I have a team out and looking for survivors. They just send a signal, they need a pick-up!"

119686	"Those terrorist rats are crawling all over the place and my ships! But they don't know what they're in for, right?"
119687	"I've received numerous reports that the site has been hit by raiders. Your presence is requested."
119688	"Listen, I need an opening to get into the Orbital Watch base. You provide the fireworks, I get the job done. Sound like a plan?"
119689	"This is a disaster! With the Climate Stabilizers the Oribital Watch could wreak havoc across the globe... Don't let it come to that!"
119690	"Us Arctic Custodians have no defense for when the Orbital Watch reaches us. I am counting on our partnership with you."

117960	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] welcomes you to your new building grounds.
117961	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] introduces herself as a member of the Global Union.
117962	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] instructs you to operate a space port here.
120147	"Customs have been a pain, they won't let my house plants through to the moon! I guess encasing them in resin first is decorative, too."
120148	"Many of us have family up on the moon now, including me. Can you pick up the parcels to make sure they're not lost in transit?"
120149	"Peparations for our first Culinary Art Fair are well under way! We strive to show how people around the world and beyond eat."
120150	"I can't believe we won the raffle! A fancy dinner on a cruise, it doesn't get more romantic than that! We do need a ride, though..."
120151	"Look around you, everyone's wearing high collars this season. And we're the main supplier, just check the order list."
120152	"I am the sponsor of the animal repopulation efforts in this area. Your contribution would send a strong signal! We need various species."
120153	"Some don't understand why my three-star restaurant doesn't serve meat. Well, I call this a lifestyle. Interested in being my supplier?"
120154	"Care to join me on a tour to appreciate the skyline? This city flourished thanks to us, after all."
120155	"I've been saving for forever to get my diving school off the ground! But I do need the perfect spot now, too."
120156	"Hey! Can I hitch a ride with you? It's an unconvential way to travel out here, but there are stranger things."
120157	"The food up here is decent, but I can't help but miss the food from home, you know? A lot of us feel that way, so why not boost morale?"
120158	"Vegetables are all fine and dandy, but what about fruits? All were told is 'nah, need too much water'! You don't think so, right?"
120159	"Everyone can come up here now! Well, not really anyone. Can you help with signatures for a petition to keep dogs?"
120160	"I heard about the dog petition, it's preposterous to keep a pet in such a hostile environment! They're better off with pet algae."
120608	"I got two strange newcomers. No IDs and not from here, but they insist on finding a blue box out there. Heck, if I knew how they got here!"
120864	"It's that time of the year again! So I had my little helpers lay out some stocking fillers for my dearest friends. At a well-fitting place, if I may say so."
120865	Presents unlocked in all sessions
120878	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] thinks he deserves the milk and cookies now.

120881	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] can't believe people are mistaking him for Santa.
