118148	Your employees have needs. Check if they are missing anything by clicking on residences or observing the goods shortage warnings in the top right corner.
118149	If your employees' needs are not met, they will turn angry and ultimately move out. Make sure it doesn't come to that or your revenue will decrease!
118150	It is possible to build, destroy and induce promotion for multiple buildings at once. Select the proper mode, then click and drag across the area or the buildings you want to affect.
118151	To leave your sector and return to the strategy map click on globe symbol in the top left or press ([KEYBINDING ui.toggleMetaUI()]).
118152	To check which goods and how many of them are being produced in your current sector, check the goods overview on the bottom left.
118153	When unsure what to do next, check the status of your assignments by clicking on the assigment icons on the left side.
118154	Some buildings require special mountain or coastal building sites. Those are limited, so plan ahead carefully.
118166	To claim new building grounds, navigate your command ship close to a warehouse slot, select it and click on the claim button.
120551	Public services are less efficient over the distance. Residences that are far away from e.g. a security station consume more of the station's supply.
118167	Hold the + key on your numpad to speed up the game.
118168	Not all employees of every level can be promoted. Keep building residences in order to promote more people.
118169	Familiarize with your allies as well as your rivals by taking on assignments. Of course you will be rewarded for completing them.
118170	When building space become scarce, rotating buildings can help. Use the middle mouse button or ([KEYBINDING game.changeRotation(1)]) and ([KEYBINDING game.changeRotation(-1)]) before placing them.
118171	You can toggle the automatic promotion for your employees. While manual promotion gives you more control, automatic promotion saves time.
118172	Global and orbital trades are the key in supplying your cities. When creating Transfer Routes on the strategy map, you can decide on the destination as well as the type and amount of the transferred goods.
118173	Acquiring new sectors is important to advance your corporation. The Big Five hold ownership rights of most potential new territories. You'll need to do business with them.
118174	Bridges are your gateway to new construction areas. Click on a bridge building site and select upgrade to begin its construction.
118175	Employees of the Arctic region have a unique need: Heat. Build production facilities close to residences to use exhaust heat for heating.
118176	There is no need to build new factories all the time. You can also increase their output by building production modules.
118177	Factories can be quite hungry for resources. By constructing adjacent modules you can reduce energy consumption, needed workforce or logistic requirements.
118178	Your entire fleet lies at anchor at the docks. Enter them from the strategy map and upgrade or expand your fleet there.
118179	Yours is not the only corporation around. To see how your competition is doing, click on your company logo in the top right. Here you'll see your rivals' corporation levels.
118192	As your company grows, its corporation level increases. Each level up rewards you with lucrative advantages.
118193	In every sector, a character offers you participation in a joined project. Whether you pursue it for wealth or out of curiosity, it will be worthwhile.
118194	The Big Five offer special modules in exchange for your vote in The Council.
118195	You can make a profit by selling your excess goods on the World Market.
118196	To save on a factory's maintenance costs you can pause its production.
118197	The right click menu can be enabled in the options menu. It contains basic buildings and functions for faster access.
121294	Use the Buildings Quick View to find and quickly jump to a specific building. You can also use the ([KEYBINDING session.jumpToNextBuilding()]) or the ([KEYBINDING session.jumpToPreviousBuilding()]) Hotkeys to jump between buildings of the same type.
118198	Take screenshots by pressing ([KEYBINDING game.takeScreenshot()]). Your shots will be saved in the Anno 2205 folder inside your Documents directory.
118199	You can pause the production of all factories of the same type at once. Simply hold the Shift key while pressing the pause button in the factory menu.
118200	All achievements are listed in your corporation profile. Maybe they will inspire you to challenge yourself.
120552	Watch the price developments on the World Market closely. You might be able to buy goods cheaper than they are to produce.
118201	Attend The Council to vote for one of the Big Five and gain unique advantages. All voting players of "Anno 2205" influence the Big Five's market shares, so be sure to participate!
118202	The ever-changing world market can help you make a profit, but is also dictated by all "Anno 2205" players' buying behaviour. It's located inside the Global Union space station.
118203	Lead your own excavation business in the Asteroid Miner app. This way you can gain valuable materials which are transferred to the main game.
120553	The prices for a good on the World Market may change, but the upkeep costs of a transfer route remain the same once it is established.
118204	The true pinnacle of your career will be the construction a Corporation HQ that reflects your economical power.
118205	Superconducters embedded in the streets cause the aeromobiles to fly. There is no way around constructing streets to make buildings accessible.
118206	You can stabilize crisis sectors through military intervention But conflict is always brewing there and can break out anytime.
120554	Editing a route to the world market will reset its timer but also update its good prices with the current value which can make it unprofitable.
118207	Energy can be transported between sectors via Energy Transmitters. To use them, just create a Transfer Route for energy in the same way as for other goods.
118208	Your cities reach across planes and fields, bustling with productivity. Consider adding distinctive touches with ornaments to fill those nooks and crannies.
120844	Select <font color="#f47518">Goods</font> or <font color="#6accff">Energy</font>
