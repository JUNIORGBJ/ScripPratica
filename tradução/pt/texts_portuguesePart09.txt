121307	<font size="24">Introducing Administration Costs:</font><br /><br />The more employees of the same level you employ, the higher their <font [GUI_COLOR BlueLight]>administration costs</font> become. The same applies to your amount of <font [GUI_COLOR BlueLight]>transfer routes</font>.<br /><br />When you accept these conditions, the total administration costs will be subtracted from your balance. <br /><br />These changes are irreversible, but you can find a backup of your current corporation in the manage corporation menu.
