113945	A melhor coisa é o senso de comunidade, na verdade.
113946	I'm livin' the dream!
113947	This was a piece of gray rock once. Look what you made of it!
113948	Two words... Zero gravity!
113949	Why do we need Earth? It's perfect here.
113950	This is final frontier!
113951	Course I'm good!
113952	Fly me to the Moon. Anytime!
113953	This place... just rocks. Get it?
113954	I could jump for joy, but I'm not one for heights!
113955	It's not just some crater. It's my home! And I love it!
113956	That alone makes me feel better.
113957	Regular checkups, that's what we need.
113958	Finally, I can have the doc take a look at that rash.
113959	Ready for the diggin'.
113960	One small step for me... um, you know the rest.
113961	Time to blow up some dust!
113962	The Big Five must be kickin' themselves that you stepped on the Moon before them.
113963	I'm sure, we're more efficient than the LEC folks. I mean, have you seen their mines... I wouldn't want to work there.
113964	Just like the old west here. Besides people shootin' each other and all that.
113965	I'm gettin' tired of all the moon cliches and all, you know? If you haven't lived here, you'll never understand what makes us tick.
113966	That Orbital Watch thing... I don't understand what the point is. Ain't there enough space here for everyone to live together? If they don't like us, they can have the dark side all for themselves.
115253	Oh thank you. Drake's men, they... they beat me up, spit on me, insulted me and all the other things you do to traitors.
115254	Thank you for taking us into your refugee camp! I sure it's cramped enough as it is…
115255	Thank you... thank you.
115714	And I can't even have a pet here!
115718	The overtime is killing my family time!
115719	I can't believe those Orbital Watch bastards...
115720	Landscape gets pretty boring after a while.
115721	Nothing like a party on the star deck!
115722	Can't wait to see their faces again!
115723	Oh man, I got a letter from home!
115724	A family on earth, and a family on the moon. Perfect.
115734	Keep away from the tank!
115735	This is vital work, so concentrate.
115737	Can't I test the new zero-g room?
115739	Can't even smoke here anywhere.
115740	Where'd I put that new drill head?
115741	Keep the water filters clean.
115744	Solar power sure is valuable.
115749	Lucky the airtight hull wasn't breached.
115751	I should restock our vitamin supplements.
115753	C'mon, just one letter...
115755	We'll need more shuttles soon!
115757	Don't worry about small impacts.
115761	Any volunteers for outside?
115762	Lookin' good!
105744	Security level Code Beta! Surveillance drones to positions! If they wanna sabotage our fusion reactors, they'll have to get past them first.
105745	Bad news! Our systems are showing enemy movement along the borders!
115860	Quick, boot up the energy shields!
115876	At first we mistook it for another meteorite. And now we've taken a closer look, we're even more confused. The satellite doesn't belong to the LEC, the Orbital Watch or any of the Big Five. I've never seen that logo before.
113980	That turned out well.
113981	I rate this A 1.
113982	That's a success of the first grade.
113983	A satisfying result.
113984	That's perfect.
113985	Well done.
113986	Outstanding!
113987	Great job!
113988	Not bad.
113989	Nicely done!
113990	That's Better.
113991	I'm glad you fixed that.
113992	One less thing in our way.
113993	You carried it out to perfection.
113994	You came, you saw, you succeeded.
113995	A great job you did there!
113996	Home and dry. Well done.
113997	You're a true leader!
113998	Ha, you saved the day!
113999	I like your style!
114000	Congratulations on your success.
114001	Hey, Good result!
114002	You should be commended for that.
114003	That went ugly.
114004	Clearly a mess.
114005	It couldn't be helped.
114006	That went downhill.
114007	That was bad.
114008	Poorly executed.
114009	That really missed the mark.
114010	Dang it, that sucks.
114011	Move along, nothing to see here.
114012	That's a mess.
114013	Look, nobody's perfect.
114014	That'll come to haunt you.
114015	That'll get you nowhere.
114016	You see, no plan survives first contact.
114017	Didn't you see it coming?
114018	You seem to be off your game.
114019	Sometimes, it's just beyond you.
114020	You just can't control situations like that.
114021	There are times when you have to admit defeat
114022	Your strategy was flawed, I'm afraid.
114023	Hey, what's up?
114024	Is it urgent?
114025	Yes?
114026	Nothing to report here.
114027	You got orders for me?
114028	No, I don't mind visitors.
114029	Oh, are you doing an on-site inspection?
114030	How can I help you?
114031	At your service!
114032	Hi, what can I do for you?
114033	The honor's mine.
114034	Affirmative!
114035	Roger.
114036	Copy that.
114037	Understood.
114038	I'll make you proud!
114039	I hear you.
114040	Don't worry! I'm on it.
114041	You're giving the orders.
114042	I'll do this instantly for you.
114043	Not on my watch.
114044	No.
114045	I can't do that.
114046	Definitely not.
114047	Not now.
114048	We aren't equipped for something like that.
114049	We can't risk that.
114050	Don't mistake this for insubordination. But I have to say no.
114051	I was given other duties, so I can't you see.
114052	Sorry, you got me at the wrong time.
114053	We still got time.
114054	This situation needs help.
114055	It's not a routine problem. I hope you have a good plan.
114056	Everything's ready. You can take over from here.
114057	How do we proceed?
114058	We have a code red here. Something has to be done!
114059	You got it in under the wire.
114060	Mission accomplished!
114061	That's the spirit!
114062	I'm happy you're the one calling the shots here.
114063	Man, you really are someone to rely on.
114064	There's no situation you can't handle, right?
114065	All done. You're outstanding!
114066	You do what has to be done. And you do it well.
114067	Don't want to think about consequences!
114068	I'm underwhelmed!
114069	At least you can say the worst is over. I think.
114070	But... it's our duty.
114071	I see, you're actually deserting us...
114072	That only postpones the problem...
114073	Status report?
114074	The mission details?
114075	Are there results already?
114076	I have nothing to report. What about you?
114077	Rapid execution, that's the key.
114078	The problem presists
114079	Here's the key parameters.
114080	You don't need reinforcements, right?
114081	You have it in your sights.
114082	That's of strategic importance.
114083	This is what we're looking for.
114084	Target object located.
114085	Found it.
114086	Ready for takeover.
114087	It's nonhazardous. Just take it.
114088	That's part of the objective.
114089	Lead the way.
114090	Target location confirmed.
114091	Take care.
114092	Right ahead.
114093	Come on!
114094	Make your move.
114095	Destination in sight.
114096	Yeah, proceed to that location.
114097	[Sigh] Stealth operation failed.
114098	They spotted us.
114099	We're on their radar
114100	Getting closer.
114101	We're almost within reach.
114102	You're going in the right direction.
114103	You found it.
114104	It's located. Finally.
114105	So, this is the one then?
114106	Thanks. But there's another problem hanging over our heads right now.
114107	Great outcome. But you'll have to do this too, if you wanna remain like this.
114108	The danger's not fully banned yet. This calls for a follow-up mission.
114109	Awaiting orders. Forces ready to respond to provocation.
114110	Enemy activity sighted. Your orders?
114111	Prepare yourself, this is a war zone.
114112	We should increase security here. Preferably by eliminating the danger.
114113	The best defense is a good offense. Let's see if that's really true.
114114	You are one of the great strategists of our time.
114115	With you, victory is practically certain.
114116	You sure don't pull any punches.
114117	That's not how you win a war.
114118	At least go down fighting.
114119	We should try another tack next time.
114120	Ever thought of making this a prison planet. I mean, it already feels like one.
114121	You expect me to give my best, while providing me the worst quarters imaginable?
114124	I think I'll apply for a transfer soon. Back to Earth.
114125	I know war zones that are more homelike.
114126	The safety policies here... just reckless.
114127	It angers me to see all the injustice here.
114128	If you wanted to freeze me out, then congratulations.
114129	This place will sink into chaos. Mark my words.
114130	Nothing out of the ordinary here. Sadly.
114134	Sometimes I think there must be more to life than this.
114135	We're fulfilling our quota. But should that really be all it's about?
114122	I don't know where to start...
114123	Signing that contract... I should have thought it through.
114131	Just the daily routine. I don't want to bore you.
114132	It's a dangerous life here, but honestly, where isn't?
114133	I guess the situation here is under control.
114136	I'm as happy as one can expect, living on a gigantic gray rock.
114137	Don't expect any complaints from my side.
114138	This vast emptiness really grows on you.
114139	I've been worse off.
114140	Everything is in good shape here.
114141	I'm glad to be here.
114142	Sometimes it's a tough ride. But then again, it's a big adventure, too.
114143	This place has good prospects, if you ask me.
114144	Whatever it is, we can deal with it.
114145	Been awhile since I heard an alarm here.
114146	Everything's safe, orderly... very nice.
114147	I wouldn't have expected that life on the Moon to be so... convenient.
114148	It's a life worth living!
114149	Hard work brings us together. I like that.
114150	You are the conqueror of space!
114151	The view alone! Indescribable!
114152	I'm living at the forefront of the future. What's not to envy?
114153	Other people pay good money to see this. And I have it all for free.
114154	Nothing and no one could make me leave.
114155	If someone bothers you, you can just mute him on your headset. Not like that happens a lot, though.
114156	It's a great honor to work for you.
114157	Volunteering for this was the best decision I ever made.
114158	I'm living here. I repeat that a lot, because otherwise I wouldn't believe it myself.
114159	Is this great, or is this great?
114160	Exactly, safety first.
114161	Good to see your security policy doesn't end with information evenings.
114162	How would our colony work without them, right?
114163	Reporting for duty.
114164	I'll keep everything in order!
114165	Can't wait to do my part!
114166	At work, I mostly talk in abbreviations... I don't want to be the one responsible for a shuttle crash or something, just because my commands took too long.
114167	Have you ever heard of Global Trust? It was a big company last century... until they settled for space. Makes me shudder, thinking of the poor folks they left for dead on Mars.
114168	Giant steps, that's what you take, walkin' on the Moon.
114169	Thought-out work safety guidelines, that's the essential thing. Just think what happened at the Bainbridge Crater. I say that's the real reason they tried to replace the LEC via the lunar program.
114170	You know, when I first watched the earthrise on the colony shuttle trip, I knew I belonged here.
115726	They're doing what now?
115727	It feels more like a coffin than a home.
115728	I don't miss Earth all that much.
115729	There's just not much to do around here...
115730	The moon gravity is great for my back.
115731	I never thought I'd grow this attached to the place.
115732	I'm never going back to Earth!
115733	Sports in zero gravity, awesome!
115738	These are not the circuits you're looking for.
115742	And a sunlight refractor over there...
115743	Careful not to overload the systems.
115745	Let's take a test walk on the moon!
115746	Okay, airtank is sealed. Done!
115750	Sure thing, I can fix this.
115752	You know what the speed limit is on the moon son? do you?
115754	Stand back, I'm closing the hatch!
115756	Damn, the Watch took out a transporter...
115758	Wait a sec, the lock is opening.
115759	Can I see your dosimeter?
115760	So, about dinner...
116088	We are under attack!
116089	Battlestations! They're attacking!
116090	Here they come!
116091	Enemy detected! All hands engage!
116092	We're under fire!
116093	We're sinking!
116094	Mayday!
116095	Into the lifeboats!
116097	Object identified.
116098	Objective sighted.
116099	Mission objective ahead!
116100	Allied ships located.
116101	Help is on the way!
116102	Reinforcements have arrived!
116103	Missiles launched!
116104	Fire from above!
116105	Missile attack confirmed!
116106	E.M.P. activated!
116107	Activate pulse!
116108	And light's off!
116109	Mine planted.
116110	Wave Mine free!
116111	Wave Mine released!
116112	Shields are up!
116113	Full protection!
116114	Shields up. Full spead ahead!
116115	System overhaul concluded.
116116	Repair drones active!
116117	System repairs in progress!
116118	Requested submarine has arrived!
116119	Surface!
116120	Calling in backup!
116121	Long-range missile away!
116122	Missile away!
116123	Commencing missile strike!
116124	Cold bomb detonating!
116125	Drop successful!
116126	Prepare for impact!
116127	Activating vortex!
116128	Tide controllers activated!
116129	Vortex is building.
116130	Shields are up!
116131	Defenses, full power!
116132	Shield amplified.
116133	Repairs started.
116134	Renovations in process.
116135	Mending hull.
116136	Copy that!
116137	Full speed ahead!
116138	Affirmative!
116139	Under way!
116140	Roger!
116141	Coordinates confirmed!
116142	On our way!
