112158	You know life is good when you can be certain that people will smile back at you on the street.
112159	At first, my wife was skeptical, but when I showed her this city... her jaw literally dropped.
112160	And we owe it all to you! Thanks a lot!
112161	I don't have a lot of free time. And every day still feels like a holiday, here.
112162	We'll be the company that conquers the whole solar system! I know we will!
112163	It's not like working for a company. It's like helping a friend.
112166	My colleagues and I were just talking this morning about how we could use one of those nearby.
112167	Yeah, good to have one in the neighborhood!
112168	Thanks! I'll pay it a visit right away.
112169	Got work to do? We're on it!
112170	Nice apartments! Makes me look forward to quitting time.
112171	Someone called for some workers?
112172	I always dreamed about going to space when I was a kid. And now I'm working to make it come true, for all humanity!
112173	Manual labor's tough enough. But I don't wanna think about what those poor folks on the Moon have to go through.
112174	Got me some private projects at home, for relaxing. I'm building some furniture... and... redoing the roof... and... finishing the attic. You know, relaxing stuff.
112175	You tried that Ibarra-FoxCom Build-a-Bot kit? Impossible. I just don't have the patience for puzzles.
112176	Spaceports... those're big projects. I hear there's lots of work gangs that never see each other, just because they work in different areas of the construction site. Amazin'.
115548	I can't believe they'd treat us like this!
115549	Sorry, gotta dash, I can't lose this job now.
115550	Maybe I should rake in my overtime benefits.
115551	Oh damn, where'd I put my keys?
115552	Time to reward myself with some takeout!
115553	Living on the Moon? Sounds pretty awesome!
115554	You bought meat? That's gonna be delicious!
115555	All these public holidays are pretty great.
115581	This was a big chunk, well done!
115582	Ouch, my thumb!
115583	That's a good one, we can use it.
115585	Oh, you'll get used to the smell.
115587	What do the results say?
115589	Let's get these crates moved!
115591	Don't spill those!
115602	Is all the paperwork filled out?
115603	Can I get a pair of hands over here?
115604	Did you see that? We should come more often!
115611	I'm so glad we still got tickets.
105397	Impressive progress! Now that the geeks are here, we can all start compartmentalizing and forming our little cliques!
112368	Wow!
112369	Perfect!
112370	A top notch performance!
112371	Incredible!
112372	That's sensational, really!
112373	There's no way anyone could have done better!
112374	Ten out of ten!
112375	Words fail me.
112376	How super!
112377	People will tell this story forever!
112379	Wow you solved it.
112380	Everyone is glad this is done with.
112381	The news spread like wildfire. It's over at last!
112382	You're definitely the leader type!
112383	I thought that was impossible. And then you did it.
112384	I don't know how you manage to do this!
112385	You'd better get ready for a lot of thank yous!
112386	Everything in the green, thanks to you!
112387	Sorry, but I just have to hug you!
112388	You are absolutely incredible!
112389	With you at the helm, how could anything go wrong!
112390	No doubt about it, you certainly know what you're doing!
112391	You hit it outta the park!
112392	Oh, please, no.
112393	Oh no. Not quite optimum. Not even close, to be honest.
112394	Oh snap!
112395	Oh, great.
112396	Wasn't meant to be.
112397	Next time.
112398	Seriously?
112399	Ouch!
112400	Don't think it could get any more out of control.
112401	[Sigh] I just want to go home.
112402	And I was so certain you would solve this.
112403	You're my employer, so I'd better not speak my mind about this.
112404	It's the thought that counts, you know.
112405	I know, I know, you do what you can.
112406	Well, at least you tried, I guess.
112407	Excuse me, where do I go to lodge a complaint?
112408	Pretty so-so, don't you think?
112409	Looks like you pushed the wrong buttons, huh?
112410	If you can't do it, I wonder who can.
112411	You failed. We've all been there.
112412	You, here, I'm sorry, I'm just a little nervous.
112413	Can I get you something? Tea, coffee? Or can I do something for you?
112414	You should have let me know. I don't have anything in the fridge.
112415	You, here? And I haven't even cleaned up.
112416	Yes, is there something you want?
112417	So, how may I be of service?
112418	Well... This is a nice surprise. What... What can I do for you?
112419	You came to see me? I didn't expect that, to be honest.
112420	Is there something the matter at work?
112421	Oh, welcome.
112422	Right away.
112423	Anytime.
112424	Query confirmed.
112425	Understood.
112426	Okay. All systems go!
112427	You'll be happy.
112428	Your wish is my command. Within reason.
112429	As you like.
112430	Why certainly.
112431	I'll inform you when it's done.
112433	Operation not feasible, sorry
112434	Couldn't find a replacement, sorry.
112435	Sorry, no.
112436	I can't. Have to monitor the systems.
112437	Other priorities, sorry.
112438	Sorry to tell you, but that's impossible right now.
112439	Sorry, I have to put your request on hold.
112440	Normally, I wouldn't refuse you... but... work, you see?
112441	Please, don't be cross with me.
112442	You see, I'm pretty overworked as it is.
112443	I've had this on the radar for a while. Could you take care of it?
112444	I know, it hasn't gone through the official channels. But it is important.
112445	The required channels proved ineffective. That's why I approached you directly.
112446	Excuse me? Excuse me. I wanted to pass along this request, if you don't mind.
112447	This just came in. Looks pretty urgent.
112448	Please don't consider me cheeky. I just thought I'd better ask you in person.
112449	Process concluded! Thank you very much!
112450	Everything back in working order! Thank you!
112451	Whew, that was a five star performance!
112452	Whoa, your thank you's are piling up!
112453	Thank you. You really pulled out all the stops!
112454	The emergency indicator is dropping again! You did it!
112455	Wow. Thank you!
112456	Operations are running smoothly again. You certainly saw to that!
112457	[Sigh] Suboptimal.
112458	Disappointed? No, no! Well... yeah.
112459	They're already gossiping pretty viciously around here.
112460	Oh... I see... too bad...
112461	Of course. I'm sure you have more important things to do...
112462	No input. No output.
112463	Any progress? Shall I update the database?
112464	You have all the required information?
112465	The status indicator reads "In progress". You're on it, then?
112466	Can I set it to "done", or do you still need time?
112467	Oh, it's you. Is there any news regarding the assignment?
112468	It's in the pipeline? Well, if you say so...
112469	I know you're a busy person. But I hope you find the time for this soon.
112470	I hope you're not stuck or something.
112471	Confirmed. This is it.
112472	According to the database, you found the right one.
112473	Data collation shows a match.
112474	It looks like the one specified, at least.
112475	Checked it. It's the right one.
112476	We have that one in the assignment survey.
112477	The tracking number's correct. That should be it.
112478	Oh, yes, I think that's it.
112479	Location confirmed.
112480	Heads-up memo is out. They're expecting you.
112481	Coordinates transmitted.
112482	Confirmation received. This is the target location.
112483	Seems you don't need any further directions.
112484	All is prepared for your arrival, it seems.
112485	Let's go!
112486	Yes, get there, please.
112487	They've detected us.
112488	They have us on their radars.
112489	Mission cancelled. They know our position.
112490	Almost there, according to the data.
112491	It's close by here, I'm sure.
112492	It's here, somewhere within our radius.
112493	Object detected.
112494	Confirmed. You found it.
112495	Located.
112496	Thank you. Unfortunately, the data indicates that the problem has not been solved completely.
112497	Thank you! How about taking on another task, now all processes are up and running?
112498	Incredible! You don't mind me bothering you again, do you?
112499	The marine radio messages coming in say it's a real battlefield out there. Are you willing to help?
112500	The hazard display for oversea travel is in the red. Shouldn't someone do something?
112501	The data indicates a critical increase of military incidents. Not good.
112502	It's a lot to ask of you, but we don't feel particularly safe anymore.
112503	When will someone put an end to all this pointless fighting?
112504	Whew, let's hope we have seen our share of violence for a while.
112505	Just came in. Congratulations for your victory.
112506	Reports are in. You were victorious straight across the board.
112507	The damage reports are disastrous. And the casualties... I'll keep quiet about that.
112508	So much for the futility of war...
112509	Thanks for putting your head on the block for us. I'm glad you still have it.
112510	We're surrounded by cutting edge technology. But on a human level... this feels like the middle ages.
112512	People quit and I get stuck with all the work. If it at least paid off.
112513	My life is like the vending machine in our break room: Push buttons all day and for what? Nothing.
112514	Oh yeah, a spaceport on the doorstep. Ever tried to actually reach for the stars here?
112515	It's not just me! My whole department is fed up!
112516	Cheap housing, challenging duties, yeah! Sounds nice on paper, but in reality.
112517	I lost count of how many complaints I've filed.
112519	I hope you came to hand me my pink slip. I want out of here!
112511	[Sigh] All the promises that were made...
112518	I asked around. Other firms provide much better working conditions.
112520	It's not all sunshine and roses here. But I get along.
112525	I make a living. What else can I expect?
112528	We could make this an even better place to be. But with all the work.
112521	Get up, go to work, go home. The usual.
112522	Not bad here, for the most part.
112523	Things are fine here but there's something... can't quite put my finger on it.
112524	I think we all get along with one another pretty well here.
112526	Sometimes I feel like there's something missing.
112527	Happiness? That's a big word.
112529	On the whole, it's a decent workplace.
112530	I have no reason to complain!
112531	I like my job, I like my home. Those are pretty nice feelings to have.
112532	Oh, I don't mind having visitors. People around here are all so nice.
112533	I have the feeling our needs are taken seriously here.
112534	Just keep smiling. It's not all that hard here.
112535	Yes, I've had a pretty good day so far. No wonder.
112536	I'm in a really good mood.
112537	I think we have a bright future ahead of us.
112538	Everything is in apple-pie order. Thanks to you.
112539	Nothing to report. We are all doing pretty fine.
112540	The wages, the climate at work, talk about a plum job!
112541	How couldn't I want to work for you!
112542	Thank you for making all this possible!
112543	And I came to live here! Lucky me!
112544	I have a few days off, but I can't wait to go back to work. I love it!
112545	Motivation is at an all-time high!
112546	Your space colonies will be a hit, judging from how incredible it is down here.
112547	I love taking walks through our city, just to take in its beauty.
112548	You rock! You totally rock!
112549	Honestly, could it even get any better?
112711	Thanks. We really missed having something like this.
112712	Wow. I must say I'll sleep much better tonight.
112713	You keep the streets safe. Thank you!
112714	Operators at your service!
112715	All systems online! Can't wait to get started.
112716	Okay, let's set things in motion!
112717	Lately, we've shifted from touchpad to voice command systems. Makes the job easier, unless you're hoarse.
112718	After a day staring at monitors, nothing beats reading a book, you know. They're one of those weird, costly historical hobbies.
112719	Running a space program involves millions of technical processes all having to unfold in perfect synchronicity. Good thing you have us.
112720	To the Moon? No thanks. I'm a down-to-earth person, myself.
115556	They're talking about redundancies.
115557	I can't do my job like this!
115558	And pile after pile after pile of paper...
115559	Why do my plants keep dying?
115560	Let's apply for some vacation time!
115561	We should definitely get a second coffee machine.
115562	New appartment: check!
115563	I could get used to going out for dinner.
115584	Hey, keep that helmet on!
115586	We've got a couple hundred orders to go.
115588	Stay away from those batteries!
115590	Good, contamination's at a minimum.
115593	I need a new container for this.
115594	Careful with the dust.
115596	Yeah, that's a lot of water.
115597	Alright, the flow is stable.
115598	Sending off in 3... 2... 1...
115599	Vacuum these, thanks.
115600	Stop stacking crates there, there's more space over here.
115601	It's a tight schedule, but we'll make it.
115605	C'mon, let's skip the ads.
115607	Okay, where did you last see him?
115610	Of course, more delays.
115791	Leave the bureaucracy to us. You should use your leadership skills to get those colony shuttles into space.
112732	An excellent solution.
112733	Excellent.
112734	It worked.
112735	Very efficient.
112736	Good.
112737	That will definitely yield something.
112738	So far, so good.
112739	Well done.
112740	A definite win!
112741	Perfect.
112742	Then we can shelve this, finally.
112743	If that isn't good news.
112744	Fewer restrictions. Excellent.
112745	You are heading for success!
112746	Without you, that wouldn't have gone so smoothly.
112747	Our shares are rising!
112748	And again, our corporation makes the headlines!
112749	You always know what to do. I am impressed.
112750	There is no problem you can't solve, am I right?
112751	That only shows your talent as a leader.
112752	You have accomplished so much for the company. Thank you.
112753	You do things right!
112754	You made this enterprise a success!
112755	And it all started so promisingly.
112756	What a setback.
112757	Pointless and profitless.
112758	Oh, for crying out loud!
112759	An economic catastrophe!
112760	A huge outlay with no return.
112761	I can see the red ink right in front of me!
112762	How could it come to this?
112763	Terrible.
112764	Well, I hope things will get better.
112766	And there goes your careful plan.
112767	You should have delegated that.
112768	I hope we can somehow compensate for this.
112769	This will affect our market value...
112770	Not your personal best, if I may say so.
112771	I don't question your decisions... But what was the point?
112772	You know what that means for the company?
112773	Your approach was unrealistic, to begin with.
112774	You'd better have planned for this outcome, as well.
112775	I'm sure you had the best intentions.
112776	Ah, good day. What can I do for you?
112777	Ah, welcome. Is there something to discuss?
112778	My pleasure. Please, take a chair.
112779	A meeting, here in my home? Well, why not!
112780	Won't you come inside?
112781	Something official? Or are you just dropping by?
112782	Do we have an appointment? Oh, never mind... come in!
112783	I can always make time for you!
112784	Yes, please?
112785	So, how is business?
112786	Say no more.
112787	I will take care of it immediately.
112788	Of course.
112789	I have assigned it a high priority.
112790	I put someone on the matter.
112791	As you wish.
112792	I will have someone see to it for you.
112793	Yes. I will keep you briefed.
112794	If you want to delegate that to me, sure.
112795	You can trust me on this.
112796	That would cause some problems with my schedule.
112797	Not now. Please make an appointment!
