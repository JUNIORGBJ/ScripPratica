110754	The feeling of victory. Unfamiliar for us.
110755	Good to have you back in one piece, I guess.
110756	I understand what you must've been through.
110757	We've lost the battle, but we will not stop fighting.
110758	They know my face. It would be too dangerous to our cause if I were to do it myself.
110759	The Orbital Watch is on my tail. But someone has to take care of this!
110760	Please, many lives depend on this.
110761	The Orbital Watch is tightening the noose around us. Can I entrust you with this.
110762	There's always hope. You've shown us that.
110763	You enable us to keep up the resistance.
110764	Virgil Drake might be one step ahead of us. But he's more than one step behind you.
110765	That's a heavy setback!
110766	We won't recover from that so easily.
110767	I really thought you could at least make a difference.
110768	Damn. They spotted us!
110769	See. Not easy to keep a low profile.
110770	And back to hiding.
110791	Almost there.
110792	It's nearby. Stay on your guard.
110793	Just a short way to go.
110794	Ah, there is it.
110795	You're always keeping track, right?
110796	Search successful.
110797	All that's left of the LEC.
110798	I just might have what you need.
110799	Look first. Then we'll talk.
110800	You want something? Let's see what I got.
110801	I know, my product range could be broader...
110802	A few containers remained here. Feel free to browse.
110803	Welcome to our secret warehouse. Help yourself.
110804	Moon goods, huh? There might be something left.
110805	Good choice!
110806	Remember, you didn't get that from me.
110807	Thank you. We can use the money.
110808	Thanks. But don't expect a receipt.
110809	One hand washes the other.
110810	Thanks for supporting us.
110811	It's yours.
110812	Make sure you don't give us away.
110813	Good thing that's off my hands.
110814	Hot merchandise, be careful.
110815	I was looking for this, thanks.
110816	You have no idea how badly we need something like that.
110817	It's hard for us to get these things.
110818	This will be helpful.
110819	Had to buy it.
110820	Fair price. Even we can afford that.
110821	Will come in handy someday, I'm sure.
110822	Hope I can get it past the Orbital Watch.
110823	I'll take it right away.
110824	Finally, I got one. Thanks.
110826	I despise those terrorists! But their hate... That doesn't surprise me. You Earthlings take it all for granted. That we always deliver on time. People aren't just numbers on a spreadsheet, you know.
110827	Beauty of nature? Look, I grew up here. I don't care about your forests or valleys or beaches. We seek beauty in people, not in the landscape.
110828	Virgil Drake... he was in the LEC's middle management before, I hear. Paper-pusher turned extremist. Wouldn't be the first time.
110829	Many moon natives aren't exactly happy about the arrival of the Second Wave. But if the Orbital Watch is the alternative, I'd join forces with you any day.
110830	Mobility. That's our strongest weapon against the Orbital Watch. Our resistance may be scattered. But don't think we are not united.
110831	Even in my cargo delivery days, I didn't spend this much time on the road. Or should I say: On the run.
110832	My spies told me, Drake has some serious health problems. Maybe that's what it's really about... putting your mark on the Moon before it's all over.
110833	Don't think these corporations are totally innocent. The Ministry of Orbital Affairs never cared for the problems here, just for the results. And you see the results.
110834	The Orbital Watch stop at nothing. Terrorists attack oxygen tanks and supply convoys, strangling people into submission.... So many dead, still floating around somewhere in their space suits.
110836	It's not that I decided to be the head of the resistance. It's just that I have a fleet of transporters and a lot of fugitives who need passage and sustenance.
114982	I don't know you, but we seem to have the same enemy. I'm Zandra Haynes., and I speak for the Lunar Excavation Corp. Provided you still acknowledge it. Maybe we can help each other out with goods.
115804	My people can use every credit and every crate of goods. Come by my camp if you have something to spare.
115805	I know we can't give much. But we will be satisfied with whatever we can get. Just one deal, okay?
115806	These people are relying on me to supply them. Doing business with me won't hurt you.
115807	No idea why people come to me when they want to offer you Assignments. See for yourself.
115808	People still occasionally contact the LEC with Assigments. You should accept them. They sure are profitable.
115809	The Orbital Watch is a threat to every moon dweller. We should all work together. Check my camp for assignments.
115881	You didn't ignore us when we needed help. Congratulations! You earned it.
115898	What? Jorgensen! I was clear about this! No outside involvement!
115767	Of course they're off-limits to you.
115768	So, you have arrived.
115763	I'm Dr. Howard Young. I speak for the Arctic Custodians.
115764	First allow me to be clear: We expect you to abide by our directives at all times. The Arctic ecosystem is very delicate.
115765	Concerning your recent... military involvement. We would prefer that you pursue such destructive activities outside our territory.
115766	A good day to you.
116316	Don't interfere with Arctic Custodian duties.
116318	Respect these rules and we'll get along just fine.
115769	And don't overfish!
115770	Fine. Your settlement seems to follow our regulations well enough. You are permitted to continue the expansion of your spaceport. Within reasonable limits.
115771	The Arctic Custodians will provide you with the technology required to establish an icebreaker dock here. Handle it with care.
115772	A few weather anomalies. Nothing we can't deal with. Enact stabilization protocol 16.3.
115773	What... why...
115774	Systems not responding! Stabilisation values approaching critical level.
115775	Storms on our borders. Around the entire Arctic Circle. Do they... do they want to isolate us completely?
115776	Whatâ€¦ someone has taken over control of the Stabilizers?
115778	You are responsible for this! It's the Lunar Licensing Program that brought those terrorists here! Consider our support suspended! And keep out of our affairs!
105605	I must admit, I underestimated you. My apologies. Be assured we will support you in your endeavours.
116331	They have the whole Climate Stabilizer network under their control!
116332	The temperatures are rising. Higher and higher. This will lead to a catastrophe!
116333	We have to stop it! The snow will melt, the icesheet will break apart, the glaciers...
115955	There you are. Not a minute too early. The Orbital Watch... They've brought in everything at their disposal!
115956	A whole fleet is steaming toward us! They've got ships that resemble floating fortresses! Nearly indestructible.
115957	They've cut a swathe of devastation through our protectorates. You're our only hope.
115958	I know why Drake attacked us. It's because we don't have any defensive measures to speak of. And our scouts have already detected another wave heading in our direction. I hope we can call on you again.
115371	The project's moving again! Come over!
115372	I could use a helping hand with our project.
115373	About our project. I guess you're needed again!
115374	You mind helping me out a little? It's something big.
115375	Don't mean to hassle you. But could you drop by sometime?
115376	I need your help here. Could you come by and have a look?
114899	It was irresponsible of you to meddle with our Climate Stabilizers without asking us. But the situation has been exacerbated, and I must say I don't see Mr. Jorgensen handling it on his own.
114900	And please remind Mr. Jorgensen not to be so careless in the future. I hate to think of what the Orbital Watch could do with our technology.
114901	You have made a substantial contribution towards maintaining Earth's climatic stability. We are not unthankful. So, if you would like some specific changes in the local weather for your benefit, you may ask.
114949	Hmm, everything seems to be in line here. Please proceed with dismantling the oil platform.
114950	Thank you for informing me. This oil rig is indeed in critical condition. You are authorized to access it and take the necessary countermeasures.
115262	Good, I see you're on-site. Now we can examine the oil leakage in this sector. All oil rig pumps to full power!
114951	It could have developed into a full-scale catastrophe. Thankfully, there are still people who are aware of their responsibility to our planet. People like you.
115527	I have to warn you. Forcing your way straight through will destabilize the whole area.
115529	This is a clear violation of regulations! This project is no longer backed by the Arctic Custodians!
116053	The Orbital Watch is staging a full-scale offensive against our settlements. We don't have a navy to speak of, while they have batteships like none I've never seen before. Help us!
116054	Their attack waves refuse to ebb. We can't hold out any longer against their battleships. The fate of the Arctic Custodians is at stake.
116055	They know we have no means to defend ourselves. And still they threaten us with wave after wave of battleships. We are fully dependent on you for support here.
116062	The next confrontation is inevitable! Prepare yourself!
116063	It isn't over yet! The next dreadnought is drawing near!
116064	There is another one coming! Hold it back! Just... hold it back!
116065	It's them! Prepare yourself!
116066	Stop them!
116067	Don't back off from them!
109099	Good.
109100	Finally.
109101	Glad that's done.
109102	Happy that's out of the way.
109103	One problem less.
109104	Glad that's resolved.
109105	One less danger.
109106	Today is a good day.
109107	Better.
109108	A satisfactory outcome.
109109	Comforting.
109110	Much better.
109111	That's a relief.
109112	You did fine, I must admit.
109113	Credit where credit's due. You did well.
109114	I have to admit, you fulfilled your duties.
109115	That was wise of you.
109116	You did better than I thought.
109117	Yes, you did well enough.
109118	Good job. Maybe I was wrong about you.
109119	You surprised me. Positively.
109120	You did a good thing today.
109121	You did a good job this time.
109122	Nothing short of a disaster.
109123	About what I expected.
109124	Terrible.
109125	Very disturbing.
109126	Not helpful.
109127	This is dangerous.
109128	More for us to worry about.
109129	Hopefully that won't set a precedent.
109130	Atrocious.
109131	Disastrous.
109132	That's what carelessness brings about.
109133	That's what happens when you don't pay attention.
109134	Now look what you've done.
109135	You're always blind to the consequences of such actions.
109136	You do know the damage this is going to cause, don't you?
109137	I expected you to be careless, but this careless...
109138	How typical of you.
109139	Should have known you'd... never mind.
109140	If you don't plan on being considerate, don't even bother.
109141	I shouldn't have asked you in the first place...
109142	Yes?
109143	What is it?
109144	What do you want?
109145	Hello.
109146	Hmm?
109147	What brings you here?
109148	Why are you bothering me?
109149	I hope it's important.
109150	Say what you need to say.
109151	Speak.
109152	I shall look into it.
109153	I suppose.
109154	Agreed.
109155	Very well.
109156	Alright.
109157	In this case, I'm with you.
109158	Okay, I'll give it a chance.
109159	Alright, let's see what I can do.
109160	Fine, I'll do it.
109161	Okay, but I'll be expecting results.
109162	No.
109163	Forget it.
109164	Not going to happen.
109165	Never.
109166	Absolutely not.
109167	I will not. And you shouldn't either.
109168	No. I'm surprised you even asked.
109169	You can't be serious.
109170	You know my viewpoint. No.
109171	Your request is unacceptable.
109172	Not for me. For the good of the planet.
109173	This is your department. Not ours.
109174	You could do something of relevance.
109175	This is of the utmost importance.
109176	Take it or leave it. But it is an opportunity.
109177	You wish to convince us of your reliability. Then walk the walk.
109178	You have set a fine example.
109179	Finally you're taking a stand for a worthy cause!
109180	You surprise me. That was well done.
109181	In all honesty, you did very well.
109182	It seems you do understand. Good.
109183	I'm seldom wrong about people. But in your case...
109184	You reveal unexpected qualities, I must say.
109185	Nothing to complain about. Good.
109186	At least you haven't wrought too much havoc.
109187	Well, what did I expect?
109188	You've done enough. We'd better take over from here.
113530	You carry a great responsibility.
113531	Do I have to remind you of your duties?
113532	I take you at your word.
113533	It is necessary.
113534	Please, adhere to our guidelines, while you do it.
113535	I'm waiting.
113536	If you're here, who's out dealing with the problem?
113537	Please, keep it in mind.
113453	I hadn't thought you'd be the kind to abandon projects.
113454	I think you're setting false priorities.
113455	Tenacity is its own reward. Although not for you, I see.
109189	There.
109190	That one.
109191	What? Yes, that.
109192	So you're not blind, after all.
109193	Yeah, that's the one.
109194	Good. That's it.
109195	Well, that's one step further than I thought you'd get.
109196	Exactly.
109197	This way.
109198	Now head over there.
109199	It's there. Can't you see?
109200	Yeah, there. Now, hurry.
109201	Stop wasting time and go.
109202	Indeed, it's here.
109203	Please go there immediately.
113539	Don't take too much time.
109204	The problem is proving more convoluted than I anticipated.
109205	So, you completed the preliminaries. Now on to the next steps.
109206	You should be familiar with the problem now. Ready to carry on?
109207	Those terrorists are a danger. And not only to us.
109208	You'll need all the forces you can muster. This will be dangerous.
109209	You will need to be careful. These people are "shoot first, forget the questionsâ€œ.
109210	We don't normally resort to violence. But this time, I give you explicit consent.
109211	We don't have the military means to deal with this. It might be different a matter for you.
109212	You have fought off disaster. I must thank you.
109213	You defused an ugly situation. Many thanks.
109214	The damage could have been much greater. You have my thanks.
116056	I must thank you. Without you, there would be nothing left of our protectorates.
116057	You are the most reliable ally we have against those madmen. I don't know why I didn't realize that earlier.
116058	It's over for now. But this is only the calm before the next storm. I hope we can count on you when the time draws nigh.
109215	One should think that if you use violence, it should make a difference.
109216	An environmental nightmare, and all for nothing.
109217	The wounded were recovered. That's the best I can say about the situation.
116059	A catastrophe. I must evacuate our nearby settlements immediately. I hope we'll get the opportunity to drive them off in the future.
116060	Our hopes were in vain. But as long as there is but a tinge of white on the glaciers, we will return to fight!
116061	So much sorrow, so much death. What are those terrorists after...
109218	We all play a part in the preservation of the arctic. Including you.
109219	Future generations will thank you.
109220	People like you are responsible for the current situation.
109221	I hold no grudge against the poachers who killed my father. I did when I was a boy of seventeen. But in time, I realized something. When you grow up in a society that defines itself through taking, having, hoarding... It becomes natural to brutalize your fellow men and be brutalized by them.
109222	There have been efforts to allow pets on the Moon. Hardly a fitting environment. Oh, that reminds me, I need to buy more dog food for Haluuq... I hope he's behaving himself while I'm away.
109223	The Arctic Custodians are here to protect treasures most people don't even know exist. Treasures like the chance to live on a healthy, habitable planet.
109224	It's not that I oppose the Lunar Licensing Program. It is just that I'm not a friend of knee-jerk actions. But maybe the corporation simply lacks experience in long-term development. Well, we've been around longer than they have.
109225	It's a constant struggle to protect our arctic preserve against the rapacious maws of big business. I wish the corporation would provide us more support, but they're too busy fishing for voters.
109226	The only thing more amazing than human greed is their unreasoning belief that they have a right to that greed. The Big Five are well-versed in this line of thought.
109227	The Arctic Custodians are mankind's environmental conscience. It's no wonder we're unpopular.
109228	Just a few of days ago, we were contacted by someone. She refuses to give her real name, so I'll refuse to accept her messages as anything other than manipulation.
109229	Earth is like a greenhouse. To protect the life inside, all of the conditions must be balanced with the greatest of care. But the Big Five prefer to throw stones.
109230	I'm often considered gruff or taciturn. I just don't suffer fools lightly.
109231	If only people would think. My apologies, I am not usually given to flights of fantasy.
109232	Possessions do not make one rich. That which one experiences makes one rich.
109233	Out here, one has time to think, to reflect. An incalculable treasure. I wish Jorgenson would embrace that. It might even cure his constant fidgeting.
109234	It is impossible to put a price on the peace and beauty the arctic has to offer. The Big Five have trouble accepting that.
109235	I will never forget the first time I saw a harp seal come up to breathe through a hole in the ice. A beautiful moment.
109236	How can anyone see this place and not fall in love? A rhetorical question, of course. It's not like the Big Five would even give a moment's thought as to what they're exploiting.
109237	It's Earth Day. Please, be responsible. We only have one Earth.
113456	A hunter survives by not being seen.
113457	You must learn to be nothing more than the snow around you.
113458	An opportunity lost.
113459	Quiet now, you're getting close.
113460	Now keep your eyes open. You're closeâ€¦
113461	You're close, now, very close. Look carefully.
113462	You learn the way of the hunt quickly.
113463	You did well.
113464	Good job. Maybe you do belong here, after all.
113540	Don't you dare touch anything!
113541	It's very delicate technology. You shouldn't even be here.
113542	Any careless touch of a button could lead to a disaster. You better go.
113543	You may build your facility here. And only here.
113544	I hope you've read our building regulations.
113545	This building plot is at your disposal. But don't overdo it.
113546	Oh, yes. Please, do come in!
113547	You see, the stabilizer network runs smoothly.
113548	Aren't they an engineering marvel?
113549	This building space is assigned only to you.
113550	Please, feel free.
113551	Take it. I have complete confidence in you.
115068	So, you've arrived. I'm Dr. Howard Young. First off, let me remind you to obey to our guidelines at all times. I don't want incidents like the sabotage at your headquarters to repeat themselves here.
115882	We've had our difficulties in the past. But I would like to congratulate you in all sincerity.
115931	Intruders! All ships, fire at will!
115932	Battle stations! Block all passages! Don't let anyone escape!
115933	What, how did you find... never mind, you won't live to tell anyone else...
115934	Oh, we have a visitor. All ships, battle stations! Show them what good hosts we are!
115935	Fusion energy can be a highly destructive force and we are on the verge of a breakthrough. Too bad you won't live to witness the first field test.
115936	All ships to alpha sector! Maximum security level!
115937	Weapons free! No prisoners!
115938	They're in our system! Run the security protocols!
115943	Show no hesitation! They... they cannot... just stop them!
115944	Fine. But we will have our revenge... you will see, you will see.
115945	Our... our data. I swear you will get what you deserve. I will see to it personally.
115946	Damn... now hurry! Show no mercy!
115947	All we asked for was respect... but you...  You prefer to treat us the way you've always treated us. Good, we've prepared for this eventuality.
115948	Don't try to negotiate with us. You forfeited that right the moment your shuttles took off. And now you shall have our response.
115949	Hmmm, you have prevailed. But that was just one of them...
115950	This one is just for you.
115951	Stop acting so tough! You'll have nothing by the next wave!
