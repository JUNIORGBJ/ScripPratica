118180	"Okay, let's start off with some fundamental research. We have to know exactly what kind of facility we're dealing with."
118181	"Woah, what a find! It's an Ark, an old floating research station! We should prepare for a diving expedition to examine it further."
118182	"Okay, should be sufficient living space for the team. Next we'll need capable divers. But you're the expert in staff acquisition, I guess."
118183	"Um... yeah, details... I've kinda underestimated the supply expenses. Say, could you take care of provisions?"
118184	"Divers submerging... once I get this error out of the lazer cutters. Sure, we could fall back on dull old drills. But you supply the materials, then."
118185	"Right, you're not looking for a sec, and someone goes after your research object. Looks like Usoyev's line of work. Don't be squeamish!"
118187	"We better close off the area. This is our scientific discovery! I'm not taking chances it's cannibalized in the name of profit."
118189	"Alright, I've compiled a security plan. I'm counting on you to assemble the onsite security forces. Should keep out any unbidden guests."
118190	"I'll admit it, I can't decode this all on my own. Or disassemble it. I need assistants."
118191	"Now the fun part! I've cooked up this pretty promising design for a hoisting crane. Can't wait to turn it into a steely reality."
118209	"The difficult part is to preserve the original A.I. unit. Better have some androids link up with the Ark servers and act as backup storages, just in case."
118210	"Alright, next step is to supply the Ark with electricity. The onboard accumulators went belly-up, so I hope I may tap your network instead."
118211	"I'm sure we can bring the Ark back to the surface. The propulsion system doesn't looks all that broken. With a few new parts here and there..."
118212	"Nope, the old propulsion engines can't rile up enough buoyant force to keep the Arc afloat by its own. Let's give it artificial legs!"
118213	"No working propulsion engine here. But I'm sure I can tweak some Anti-Grav engines to do the job. C'mon! This is practically failsafe!"

114660	"Okay, should be sufficient living space for the team. Next we'll need capable divers. Good you're an expert at hiring staff, huh?"
114661	"Um... yeah, details... I seem to have kind of underestimated the cost of supplies on this project. Say, could you deliver some provisions for the team?"
114662	"Divers in the water... once I get this error out of my SubAqua Breathing Unit. Sure, we could fall back on the plain old air tank, if you insist."
114663	"Right. You look away for one sec and they start dismantling your research object. Looks like Usoyev's kind of thing. Don't be squeamish!"
114664	"We'd better cordon off the area. I don't think I can handle any more unbidden guests stealing our stuff."
114665	"Okay, now for the fun part! I've cooked up this pretty promising design for a crane hoist. Can't wait to turn it into a steely reality. "
114666	"I'm sure we can bring the Ark back to the surface. The propulsion and energy systems are broken, but a few maintenance bots can probably fix that."
114667	"Alright, next step is to supply the Ark with electricity. The onboard accumulators are useless, so I hope I can tap your network instead."
114668	"Um, looks like the old propulsion doesn't provide enough lifting power. But I'm sure I could tweak some Anti-Grav engines to do the job."

113224	"We have a theory about what destroyed the dam. But we will need more manpower to verify that theory quickly."
113225	"Hmm, Lei Sheng should've tested Global Trust's designs before using them. The analysis says the dams collapsed due to water turbulence caused by subaqua rock formations. We have to minimize this risk in the future."
113226	"Lei Sheng's finance department is considering cancelling dam construction. Not enough demand, they say. Not a business case. Well, let's make it one then. "
113227	"We may now officially start building the dam. Could you see to the delivery of the required materials?"
113229	"This dam may look like it is in better condition, but the remains are far beyond repair. We should get them out of the way."
113230	"The dam building site is difficult to access. I'm curious to see if your logistics system will be up to the task."
113231	"Now all that's missing are a few tons of special steel. Still, I'm confident you will find a way to get them."
113233	"This is crucial! There's evidence that Orbital Watch agents placed underwater explosives near our dams! The clock is ticking!"
113234	"The Orbital Watch incident is making our investors nervous. Some are already withdrawing their funds. But I'm informed you are well prepared..."
113235	"It seems Lei Sheng's finance department is still not convinced. They want to inspect the dams before they allow us to bring them online. Be polite."
118101	"The question is: What made the dams collapse back then? We should analyze the debris to find out."

114681	"As any project, this requires reliable funding. I do hope you're up to the task. Your competitors didn't prove quite as determined as you seem to be."
114682	"Time to escort the work force. It didn't escape your populace that this project created countless job opportunities out of nothing."
114683	"I understand that keeping the construction site supplied with materials is quite a drain. You know, your flexibility is the reason we chose you over the Big Five for this endeavor."
114684	"Now that the materials production has wrapped up, all that's left to do is make the delivery. Don't take too long or your competitors might claim the project is a waste of time."
114685	"I was just informed of the foundation's completion. The schedule is tight, but surrounding gardens are essential. Can you choose an assortment from the local flora for the gardeners?"
114686	"The gardens require a dedicated workforce or the project will grind to a halt. It would be pretty ironic if we were to need outside help for our monument, wouldn't it?"
114687	"Marble walkways will provide the finishing touch. Afterwards we can start on the main attraction... Hang on, I'm getting a call from an investor, I have to take this."
114688	"Perfect timing, I just secured backing for our final phase. It's asking a lot, but a monument like this can't be made of anything less than titanium."

118069	"Like any project this here requires reliable funding. I could pitch in. But the Lunar Licensing project has cut into our finances already, so..."
118070	"Time to escort the workforce here. It didn't escape your populace that this project created a myriad of job opportunities out of nothing."
118071	"I understand that sustaining the construction site with materials is challenging. Then again, your flexibility is the reason we chose you over the Big Five for this endeavor."
118072	"Now that the material production is wrapped up, all that's left to do is delivering. Proceed quickly or the press might decry the project as a time sink."
118073	"So, the foundation is complete. Well, our time plan is tight, but surrounding it with gardens is still essential. Can you choose an assortment of the local flora for the gardeners?"
118074	"Our material cost calculation had to be corrected. Regardless, we won't cut our workers' salary, will we? That would cause quite the scandal."
118075	"Marble walkways will be cherry on the cake. Of course I can take care of the... Ah, hang on, a call from an investor, have to take it. You see to everything, right?"
118076	"The gardens still require a good amount of work. And you're likely not relying on external workforce for your own monument. Would be quite ironic, wouldn't it?"
118077	"The construction is in full swing. To keep up you'll have to bring in more professionals. They flock to us! After all you provide work and reliable pay."
118078	"Perfect timing, I just had a call with our stakeholders about the final phase. They want us to install a new holographic display. The processing power needed is nothing to sneeze at."
118079	"It's asking a lot, but a monument like this one can't be made of anything less than titanium. We're building this for the ages, after all."
118080	"We designed the monument to be as energy-efficient as possible. The last stages of the construction will put a strain on your power lines, however."
118081	"A harbor at the foot of the monument is still missing. How else would guests reach it? We'll be relying on tried-and-true materials for this."
118082	"There's a smear campain in motion. They say, our monument is just compensation for a, and I quote, 'dingy rathole of a city'. Let's prove your metropolis is attractive as ever."
118083	"The unveiling needs to be unforgettable. I ordered fireworks, they just need to be positioned for maximum effect. Then, you can lean back and enjoy."

114718	"So weird. Our researchers can't make head or tail of the anomalies. Good thing some of my buds are climatology experts. I called them in!"
114719	"The experts want to gather some data out at the Stabilizer. Our job is to keep electromagnetical disturbances to a minimum. You might have to switch the lights off."

114721	"Yeah, I screwed up... The Troposphere Regulator wasn't exactly broken. More like sabotaged. And on top of that, some tampered construction bot stole it! Hope we can track it somehow."
114722	"That robot has been commanded to destroy itself once it drops the stolen part somewhere. We're gonna need a whole lot of computing power to reconstruct its database, man."

118237	"Okay, the crazy stuff... We should gather some data on the strange climate anomalies here. Might tell us just what's wrong with the Stabilizer."
118238	"Oh, didn't I say? Well, the other Custodians don't want me to use their labs. We'll have to build up our own research team to analyse the data."
118239	"Hmmm, our researchers can't make head or tail of the anomalies. Good some of my pals are climatology experts. I called them in!"
118240	"The experts perform measurements at the Stabilizer. Said we, need to keep electromagnetical fluctations down or something. Whatever, keep the energy supply up."
118241	"Alright, the experts say the Troposphere Regulator in the Stabilizer core is broken. Hmm, I've always been told biopolymer tech was oh so long-lasting."
118242	"Yeah, I screwed up... The Troposphere Regulator wasn't exactly broken. More like sabotaged. And on top of that, some hacked construction bot stole it!"
118243	"That robot was programmed to destroy itself, after dropping the theft somewhere. Will take us a lot of computing power to reconstruct its database."
118244	"Reconstructed the jacker-bots memory. Looks like Orbital Watch's work. But we have the position of the Troposphere Regulator. Seize it before they do."
118245	"Regulator's cut and dry and the crew's working hard on it. Could really do with some proper equipment. We Custodians don't really have the snazziest tech."
118246	"Oh no, this is even worse than we thought! The regulator's cooling system has been turned into swiss cheese, basically. We'll need materials to fix it."
118247	"Fool me twice, shame on me! The Orbital Watch must be thinking they can just send spying drones without us noticing. Let's get them down to Earth."
118248	"I've been thinking. As long we work on-site, we're on show for Orbital Watch's sabotage. Why not move the repair work to secret, off-site locations?"
118249	"It's freezing out here, but the team's having one overheating incident after another... Don't ask me, I'm no scientist! Anyway, they need coolants."
118250	"Wow, the repairs are practically burning through our power lines. I'm told it's almost done and we just need a few more sparks to get through the final steps!"
118251	"Nice going! The Troposphere Controlling Unit was completely rebuilt. All we gotta do is install it."
109043	"Yo, this area's Custodians only. I may not... ah, stuff those stupid rules! We're in big trouble here. Got a minute?"
114920	"Pretty cold out here now, huh? That's how you know our Stabilizer is running smoothly."
114953	"Nice weather, huh? What's that old saying? Make profit while the sun shines. Something like that, anyway."
114954	"Sorry, man, but as long as it's pouring cats and dogs out there, I'm staying in here."
114955	"Uh uh, no way, man... I hate thunder."
114956	"It's natural spectacles like those that make people stay here. Seein' life in a beautiful light, so to say."
115239	Reach a Corporation Level of 12 to continue the repair process.

114810	In exchange for your share of the oil, [NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] demands that you keep a low profile for a while.
114811	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] is pleased, but suggests you two part ways for now.
114812	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] has great plans for the oil the two of you have gathered.

114943	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] explains, that private corporations tried to get hold of the Arctic's oil reserves.
114944	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] knows the Arctic Custodians aren't gentle to polluters and put a stop to oil production.
114945	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME]'s mother company offered the Arctic Custodians to take care of the abandoned oil rigs.
114946	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] is convinced of your work and asks you to start the deconstruction of the oil rig.
114947	Worried about its condition, [NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] grants you access to the northern oil rig.
114948	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] is grateful for your contribution to the environmental protection of the area. Well...
120345	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] fears the security valves will not withstand the pressure.

114727	"The pipelines of this rig are ailling. We cannot allow the oil to simply flow into the ocean, so we should seal the leakages."
114728	"Now, time to dismantle the oil rig. Keep your team size within the limits specified by the Arctic Custodians, please. I want to prevent any misunderstandings."
114729	"Always ensure your local authorities' compliance. Now we may begin with the demolition. Ship in our technicians."
114730	"I'm staying on-site to keep an eye on everything. Could you ensure a steady flow of materials? There's so much we need to properly... stow away the old parts."
114731	"This requires prompt action. One of our transporters ran aground and lost its load. Take care of the mess, but be discreet. We don't want to fuss people, do we?"
114732	"All these abandoned oil rigs... A terrible environmental safety risk for the area in times like these, what with the Orbital Watch terrorism and everything. We should... check to see how unstable they really are. Just in case."
114733	"You see? Now imagine if the Orbital Watch were to attack this oil rig. We had better gather the materials needed for any eventual repairs. The Arctic Custodians will appreciate it."
114734	"You heard Dr. Young! Let us overhaul the frame before any more... unforeseen problems occur. The safety of this region is very important to me."
114735	"The black gold flows. Slowly. We may only tap small amounts at a time. But if there were an incident which were to force us to pump faster... Something like a broken safety valve..."
114736	"Yes, the oil leakage examination is today! It must have slipped my mind. But you heard the man! Full power! I hope the safety valves can handle the pressure..."
114737	"Well, it's a good thing the Arctic Custodians have competent experts like us on call. Come, let us take care of this... problem."
118218	"The pipelines of this rig are ailling. We cannot allow the oil to simply flow into the ocean, so we should seal the leakages."
118219	"Now, to the dismantling of the oil rig. Keep your team size within the limits specified by the Arctic Custodians, please. I want to prevent any misunderstandings."
118220	"Always ensure your local authorities' compliance. Now we may begin with the demolition. Ship in our technicians."

118222	"This requires prompt action! One of our transporters ran aground and lost its load. Clean up the mess, but be discreet. We don't want to fuss people."
118223	"All these abandoned oil rigs... Such a safety risk for the area, with all the moon terrorism nowadays. We should put their stability to the test. Just in case."
118224	"See? Now imagine it had been the Orbital Watch. We better acquire the materials necessary for the eventual repairs. The Arctic Custodians will appreciate it."
118225	"You heard Dr. Young! Let us overhaul the frame before anything happens. We'll need enough fuel for our welders. The safety of this region is very dear to me."
118226	"We can't leave the Arctic Custodians to do all the hard work, this is our responsibility now. So we'll need our own crew for it."
118227	"And now the hands-on repairs! Our expert team is most trustworthy. So don't trouble yourself with the supervision. I'm here too, after all!"
118228	"The black gold flows. Slowly. We may only tap small amounts at a time. But if there were an occurence, forcing us to pump faster. Like broken security valves..."
118229	"The oil leakage examination is today! It must have slipped my mind. But you heard it! Full power! I hope the security valves can handle the pressure..."
118230	"Well, good the Arctic Custodians have competent experts like us on call. Come, let us take care of this... problem."
118231	"The rigs are more than the Custodians can handle! But with your settlement nearby we could maintain a crew to monitor the rig. At all times."
118232	"Good news! We're officially responsible for emptying this rig to prevent any further problems. The crew is here, too. Let's start the long-term surveillance."
109044	"I had hoped to meet you here. I know you are unlike other CEOs. You don't shy at making uncomfortable decisions where our environment is concerned. That's why I want to offer you this opportunity. "
