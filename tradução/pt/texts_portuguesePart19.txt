121746	So far the most popular approach to Mars seems to be sending robots first. Does it still count as an uninhabited planet then, I wonder?
121747	Analysing popular fiction I noticed that mankind used to look down on their human assistants. I suppose it must have been the envy towards such an influential position.

121985	Additionally, reports detail a former spaceport testing site.
121986	State: Not operational. Current owner unknown.
121987	The Arctic Custodian committee has decided to open another sector to corporate activity.
121988	Data shows a continental connection and isolated temperature spikes caused by geysers.
121989	Harnessing excess heat is conceivable.
121990	This sector has been considered out of commission until recently.
121991	Recovering the generator complex could prove beneficial. First assessments show minor damage, and a lack of fossil fuel.
121992	Suggested course of action: locating the outdated energy source.
117198	A true island paradise, don't you think. The coastal area here is very rich in natural resources.
117199	I wonder if that's the reason why a member of the Big Five is planning for an underwater research project.
117200	But for now that's secondary. The protocol demands that you establish a spaceport in this area.
117472	As the official owner of this sector, maybe you should join in. I mean, the ocean floor is part of your property.
117201	Wide meadows and towering mountains. And soon you will add an impressive skyline to the picture.
117202	But stay attentive. I was informed a Big Five company has been monitoring the ruined dam for quite some time now.
117203	This could turn out beneficial for you at some point. But your prime objective is to raise a spaceport here.
117473	I wonder if one could bring it into operation again. This would make this sector all the more valuable for your corporation.
117204	Big place. We'll see if it's big enough for ambitions like yours.
117205	One of my colleagues already has high hopes for the area. I'm sure he will ask you to join in his latest prestige project.
117206	First things first, though. The protocol demands you bring a spaceport into operation here.
117474	Between us, the Union is impressed with how your corporation is growing. Hardly surprising you have settled for such a vast sector.
117535	A hundred years ago this was all water. But the Custodian's climate stabilization technology created a new Arctic biosphere here.
117536	Climate Stabilizers are very difficult to maintain. The older ones fall into disrepair quite often.
117537	The Stabilizer here is especially... unstable. But as this is your sector now, I suppose you're going to fix this problem.
117538	Ice and snow. A rare sight nowadays. One you owe to the Custodian's climate stabilization technology.
117539	And sights like this leaking oil rig, we owe to industrial exploitation and human greed.
117540	But can you believe one of the Big Five offered the Arctic Custodians help with the problem? There must be something else to it.
117541	It's the Arctic Custodian's climate stabilization technology, that keeps the temperatures below zero here.
117542	Ever since it was opened, many other corporations have wanted to to do business in this area.
117543	I hear, one Big Five company is especially enthusiastic about directing trading routes through here. As the sector owner, you have the final say of course.
117605	So here you are. The Moon. Your very own piece of it.
117606	At a glance: Just a stretch of grey dust and two big gaps. But I'm certain you see the place for what it could become.
117607	Careful, though. This sector borders the Orbital Watch's territory. Union satellites spotted lunar vehicles moving in the vicinity.
117608	So keep one eye on the horizon, while you see to the foundation of your first moon colony.
117609	I'm not saying this has to be enemy intrusion. But it's something you should investigate.
117610	There, your newest settlement zone. I heard astronauts refer to this place as the "claw", for the craters' odd layout.
117611	Fact is, this sector has been exposed to frequent meteorite impacts in the past. Their fragments can act as sources for rare elements from outer space.
117612	But let's not take the second step before the first. The establishment of a lunar base should be your sole priority now.
117613	Rumor has it one of the Big Five is already planning a mining operation here. If you ask me, that sounds like a profitable joint venture.
117615	Impressive crater. Like it has been drawn with a compass. The lunar landscape has something to it, no doubt.
117616	In the days of the First Wave, there were ambitions to make this sector a tourist attraction. Unfinished business, as you can see.
117617	And now our hopes are on you. The performance of the Second Wave's first colony will prove, if the Lunar Licensing Program is worth being continued.
117618	And now you can revive the project. Maybe you'll find someone well-connected who wants to join in.
116702	I'm glad you accepted my invitation. Samantha Beaumont, Global Union supervisor of the Lunar Licensing Program.
117469	We have a lot to discuss. But first I'd like to introduce you to your Artificial Data Amalgamating Messenger.
117470	Officially, only mega corporations are allowed in the program. But I personally took a stand for you. You just have to sign in with your corporation name.
117471	Thanks. But I need to see your corporate logo as well. For identification purposes.
116716	My superiors at the Global Union had reservations about you. But I've convinced them. They even decided to allocate you high-grade territory for new corporate headquarters. Choose a sector.
116717	Almost there. We just have to negotiate the terms of your contract with Global Union. Funding conditions and the like.
116718	Oh, you want to look into the contract details. Any specific paragraphs you have in mind?
116719	And we're through. Already wasted enough time on paperwork. Let's enter your new territory and start with Phase 1 of the program. Details please, A.D.A.M.
117484	Rafferty, please come in! Rafferty!
117485	Good. Start the test run!
117207	The spaceport building side off the coast is still unstaffed. But as soon as you've built the necessary housing, your construction team will be moving in.
117213	Organic food is perceived as needless luxury by many MegaCorps. Good to see you share the Union's perspective.
117209	Great. Building material shortages shouldn't be an issue anymore!
117211	Your construction crew is one of the first ready. Keep up the pace! Your competitors will try to catch up.
117212	For the next construction stage, you'll need qualified ground staff to operate the spaceport. Make sure to adhere to Union standards, while providing the required infrastructure.
117208	You need this desalination plant. These days it's the only way to come by drinkable water.
117479	A broad range of information services. This will enable your employees to develop their interests as well as their skills.
117214	One thing I learned during my political career: Prosperity and competence springs from happiness. You've taken heed of that.
117215	Remarkable progress. You've assembled construction crews and ground personnel faster than I was expecting. You are more than ready for the first major hurdle.
117216	The program demands you to connect your city with the Global Union space station via a space elevator. So far only MegaCorps like the Big Five use such technology. But I'm sure you have the same potential!
117217	Good. You've gathered the components needed for the elevator. Only the elevator cable requires special materials you can't produce. But I arranged for a delivery.
117218	A clever move, seeing to your staff's good health. Benefits like that make you more attractive an employer.
117219	Your technicians are ready! Start the elevator construction once all other requirements are met. My associate John Rafferty is already heading here with the special material deliveries.
117480	Alright, no time to study regulations! Meet Rafferty at the coordinates transmitted! Do whatever is necessary!
117481	I'm glad you come back unharmed. This attack gave everyone at the Union headquarters shock. But the program has to go on!
117482	We've lost contact to Lunar Excavation Corp. It seems many moon colonies aligned with the Orbital Watch! It's all the more important your space elevator goes into operation!
117483	Congratulations! The first step into space! All purviews of the global economy are now accessible for you. Phase 2 of the Lunar Licensing Program starts now!
117544	Outstanding! Now we can start the expansion of... wait, what's...
