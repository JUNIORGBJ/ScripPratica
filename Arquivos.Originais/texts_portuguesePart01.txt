105211	"Developing a spaceport will be a great deal of work. Let's call in the professionals."
105387	The year is 2205. Humanity must rely on energy-intensive technology to meet the challenges posed by an environmentally changed home planet. A global energy crisis becomes more and more imminent. The newly developed fusion reactors carry a promise of hope, but require resources only found on the Moon. And so, the world government of the Global Union started the Lunar Licensing Program, allowing corporations to support the government-owned lunar mining colonies with private ones.
105213	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] asks you to provide housing for your construction crew.
105214	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] recommends you to be wary of the competition.
105217	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] reports the arrival of the construction crew.
105220	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] appreciates that you provide organic food for your population.
105441	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] is glad your biopolymer production is up and running.
117970	Build [CONDITION_PROFILE_COUNTER_CONTEXT_OBJECT] and connect it to the [GUIDNAME 1000157]
105212	"Your spaceport is furnished with high-end equipment. Skilled operating personnel is a necessity."
105388	The First Wave of Lunar Colonization lies one hundred years in the past. Today lunar mining is overseen by the government-owned Lunar Excavation Corp. Bloated and ineffective, the LEC lost the Global Union's favor long ago and was largely left on their own. Still, it took decades of lobbyism on part of the Big Five to make the Global Union start a new lunar colonization program. Prevailing against these five gargantuan corporations dominating the world market, will require you to invest only the best spaceport technology. And qualified personnel to operate it.
105215	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] points out your space program's demand for skilled ground personnel.
105216	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] is convinced your corporation has risen to bigger challenges.
105218	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] welcomes your efforts to secure the water supply.
105221	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] speaks highly of your newly built Infodrome.
105222	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] and her peers boot up the spaceport's control systems.
105398	"A long way to go. Your space elevator will lead directly to the Global Union's orbital headquarters."
105399	The unforeseen Orbital Watch shook the world to its core. One by one, the colonies of the Lunar Excavation Corporation side with the terrorists and suspend their resource deliveries to Earth. The Moon dwellers, who refuse to follow Virgil Drake's crude rhetoric live in danger of oppression. Those who can board shuttles to Earth, but many more don't have this opportunity. Drake's demand to forfeit the Lunar Licensing Program puts the Global Union in a tight spot. But for the sake of all humanity, the program has to go on. And so has the construction of your space elevator.
105413	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] wants you to build a space elevator to the Global Union space station.
105414	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] announces the coming of additional material deliveries.
105219	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] tells you additional materials will be delivered, specifically for the elevator cable.
117873	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] knows a good employer keeps his staff satisfied - like you do.
105440	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] calls on you to proceed with the elevator construction once everything else is ready.
117370	Start the upgrade
105409	"The whole sector was closed off. It seems military intervention is our only option."
105405	Before the Lunar Licensing Program, the mining of Moon resources was the exclusive domain of the Lunar Excavation Corp. But as the Global Union turned its focus away from this organization, the Moon people began to feel neglected and exploited – fertile ground for the ideology of the Orbital Watch, a well-connected terrorist organization of former LEC members. And now, their warships draw a tight circle around the Prycomber strait, blocking the Global Union's most important trade route to sabotage the Lunar Licensing program. Security engineer John Rafferty is determined not to let this happen.
105421	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] urges you to meet John Rafferty at Prycomber Search Area and retrieve the static cable.
105422	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] is relieved to see you back in one piece.
105443	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] keeps a stiff upper lip.
105444	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] spotted the location of the beleagured Union cargo ship.
117383	Enter the crisis sector
105438	Free the detained transporters
105410	"Let those lunar terrorists continue their intimidation attempts. The space program is far too important for Earth's people."
105423	Worried about the situation on the Moon, [NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] urges you to finish the space elevator.
105406	The unforeseen Orbital Watch shook the world to its core. One by one, the colonies of the Lunar Excavation Corporation side with the terrorists and suspend their resource deliveries to Earth. The Moon dwellers, who refuse to follow Virgil Drake's crude rethoric live in danger of oppression. Those who can board shuttles to Earth, but many more don't have this opportunity. Drake's demand to forfeit the Lunar Licensing Program puts the Global Union in a tight spot, but for the sake of all humanity, it has to go on.
105445	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] wants you to return to the spaceport site.
117371	Finalize the upgrade
105460	"The Arctic holds resources found nowhere else. You should consider a branch there."
105469	The second phase of the Lunar Licensing Program has begun. It points right to the North Pole, the snow-clad hoard of the Earth's last treasures. Protecting the few remaining sources of crude oil and the only ecosystem still bringing forth fish in harvestable quantities, the environmentalist organization called the Arctic Custodians held a stern watch here for almost two centuries. But as things are, the Custodians must share their white paradise with private corporations. They are not happy about this.
105424	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] announces the next phase of the Lunar Licensing Program.
105479	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] had hoped for a friendlier reception.
105478	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] can't wait to assign you arctic territory.
105461	"All formalities have been taken care of. These islands have been approved for settlement by the Arctic Custodians."
105470	Like white diamonds, the icy isles of the Arctic rise up from the sea. Cold, hard and uninviting, they form the territory of the Arctic Custodians. It was them, who developed the climate stabilization technology, enabling them to create a genuine Arctic region in a world battered by the polar melting of the late 21st century. Steadying the global weather, the climate stabilizers exposed settlement areas formerly lost to the sea – at the cost of vast amounts of energy. The Custodians have made clear, they don't want you to interfere with their delicate technology, while you are establishing your first arctic branch office.
105480	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] wants you to erect an Arctic Warehouse on one of these islands.
105481	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] officially confirms your tenures for this settlement zone.
105503	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] encourages you to choose an island of your liking.
105504	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME]  will assign you an island, once you build an Arctic Warehouse there.
117784	Move your Command Ship to a [CONDITION_SOURCE_OBJECT_ASSET]
117372	Claim the island
105462	You'll see, the Arctic landscape will impose very different requirements on your city planning skills.
